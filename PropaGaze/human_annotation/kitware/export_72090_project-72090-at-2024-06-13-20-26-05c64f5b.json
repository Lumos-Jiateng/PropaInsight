            "text_intent": "Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus\n\nEditor’s Note: Over the years, Bishop Robert Morlino of the Diocese of Madison has confirmed several of my children according to the traditional Rite of Confirmation, as his diocese has been a port in the storm for many displaced and disillusioned Catholic families.\nWe don’t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course, but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans.\nAnd now this, finally, a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud.\nBishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a “hater” for defending the Church’s teaching on marriage—an attack, by the way, which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year.\n\"If you'll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!\nAs I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.\nAs the Book of Proverbs says 'My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.\n8:7).'\nIt is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\n– Bishop Robert Morlino\nThis is what a courageous shepherd looks like!\nIn our opinion, during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history, every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done, i.e., issue a statement of fidelity to the Church’s moral theology, specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts.\nIn so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes.\nThey will be crucified in the media, yes.\nBut they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church’s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within.\nNothing less will do.\nBishop Morlino has now done it, and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds, accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news.\nMay God bless and keep Bishop Robert Morlino.\nMJM\nBishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church\nAugust 18, 2018\nDear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,\nThe past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals.\nStill more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.\nFor my part — and I know I am not alone — I am tired of this.\nI am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt!\nI am tired of the obfuscation of truth.\nI am tired of sin.\nAnd, as one who has tried — despite my many imperfections — to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people.\nThe stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening.\nHearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick.\nBut my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years.\nFor them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities.\nTo them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart.\nIf you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal.\nAlso, if you’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible.\nThere is nothing about these stories that is okay.\nThese actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church.\nFaced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair.\nAnd why?\nThe reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new.\nWe are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity.\nSo what is new?\nWhat is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others.\nUnless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the “wages of sin.”\nFor too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy.\nIn our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\nIn order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.\nWhy do we do this?\nIs it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear?\nAre we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?\nOr are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?\nPerhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this.\nIn the end, the excuses do not matter.\nWe must be done with sin.\nIt must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.\nLove sinners?\nYes.\nAccept true repentance?\nYes.\nBut do not say sin is okay.\nAnd do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.\nFor the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come.\nThe deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church.\nThere is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.\nIf you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!\nAs I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.\nAs the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.\n8:7).” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\nThere must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities.\nTo be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.\nIn this I speak of all sin.\nBut to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics.\nWe’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals.\nWe are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.\nTo call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.\nThere has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.\nThat is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.\nIt is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.\nTo fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.\nIn this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power.\nThe well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.\nWhile recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.\nIt is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.\nThe Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.\nAnd the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable.\nSuch wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred.\nChristian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.\nBut while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.\nAt the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.\nIn fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come.\nMotivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.\nThe sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians.\nThe result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.\nIt causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal.\nAnd the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.\nI said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.\nHowever, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.\nNo matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.\nI have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.\nHere now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:\nIn the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.\nThis is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.\nWe must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.\nHere again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.\nIf you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.\nIf you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.\nTo our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.\nI will address it swiftly and vigorously.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation.\nI trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.\nTo our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.\nYou are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.\nThis is to keep you very close to God.\nIn addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.\nIn obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do.\nAnd by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.\nGod will give you the graces to do so.\nAsk Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.\nAnd if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.\nTo the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.\nIt will be addressed quickly and justly.\nIf you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.\nSuch actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person.\nAgain, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.\nFurthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;\nI will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;\nI will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.\nFailure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;\nI will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;\nI ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.\nI promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;\nI ask everyone reading this to pray.\nPray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers.\nPray for our seminarians.\nAnd pray for yourselves and your families.\nWe must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and\nFinally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.\nI will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes.\nIn addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same.\nSome sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.\nThis letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.\nMore than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.\nWe must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.\nWe must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.\nWe must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.\nAgain, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity.\nI stand with them.\nI don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.\nBut I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”\nFaithfully yours in the Lord,\nMost Rev.\nRobert C. Morlino\nBishop of Madison\nThis text first appeared in the Madison Catholic Herald.\n\n",

Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church\nAugust 18, 2018\nDear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,\nThe past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals.\nStill more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.\nFor my part — and I know I am not alone — I am tired of this.\nI am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt!\nI am tired of the obfuscation of truth.\nI am tired of sin.\nAnd, as one who has tried — despite my many imperfections — to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people.\nThe stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening.\nHearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick.\nBut my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years.\nFor them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities.\nTo them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart.\nIf you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal.\nAlso, if you’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible.\nThere is nothing about these stories that is okay.\nThese actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church.\nFaced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair.\nAnd why?\nThe reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new.\nWe are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity.\nSo what is new?\nWhat is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others.\nUnless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the “wages of sin.”\nFor too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy.\nIn our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\nIn order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.\nWhy do we do this?\nIs it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear?\nAre we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?\nOr are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?\nPerhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this.\nIn the end, the excuses do not matter.\nWe must be done with sin.\nIt must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.\nLove sinners?\nYes.\nAccept true repentance?\nYes.\nBut do not say sin is okay.\nAnd do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.\nFor the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come.\nThe deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church.\nThere is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.\nIf you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!\nAs I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.\nAs the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.\n8:7).” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\nThere must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities.\nTo be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.\nIn this I speak of all sin.\nBut to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics.\nWe’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals.\nWe are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.\nTo call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.\nThere has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.\nThat is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.\nIt is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.\nTo fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.\nIn this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power.\nThe well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.\nWhile recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.\nIt is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.\nThe Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.\nAnd the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable.\nSuch wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred.\nChristian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.\nBut while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.\nAt the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.\nIn fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come.\nMotivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.\nThe sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians.\nThe result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.\nIt causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal.\nAnd the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.\nI said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.\nHowever, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.\nNo matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.\nI have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.\nHere now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:\nIn the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.\nThis is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.\nWe must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.\nHere again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.\nIf you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.\nIf you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.\nTo our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.\nI will address it swiftly and vigorously.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation.\nI trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.\nTo our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.\nYou are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.\nThis is to keep you very close to God.\nIn addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.\nIn obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do.\nAnd by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.\nGod will give you the graces to do so.\nAsk Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.\nAnd if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.\nTo the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.\nIt will be addressed quickly and justly.\nIf you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.\nSuch actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person.\nAgain, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.\nFurthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;\nI will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;\nI will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.\nFailure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;\nI will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;\nI ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.\nI promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;\nI ask everyone reading this to pray.\nPray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers.\nPray for our seminarians.\nAnd pray for yourselves and your families.\nWe must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and\nFinally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.\nI will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes.\nIn addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same.\nSome sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.\nThis letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.\nMore than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.\nWe must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.\nWe must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.\nWe must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.\nAgain, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity.\nI stand with them.\nI don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.\nBut I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”\nFaithfully yours in the Lord,\nMost Rev.\nRobert C. Morlino\nBishop of Madison\nThis text first appeared in the Madison Catholic Herald.\n\n",

(which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.\nIn this I speak of all sin.\nBut to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual — almost exclusively homosexual — acts by clerics.\nWe’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals.\nWe are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.\nTo call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.\nThere has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.\nThat is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary.\nIt is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.\nTo fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.\nIn this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power.\nThe well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.\nWhile recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.\nIt is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.\nThe Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.\nAnd the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable.\nSuch wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred.\nChristian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.\nBut while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.\nAt the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.\nIn fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come.\nMotivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.\nThe sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians.\nThe result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.\nIt causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal.\nAnd the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.\nI said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.\nHowever, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.\nNo matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.\nI have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.\nHere now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:\nIn the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.\nThis is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.\nWe must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.\nHere again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.\nIf you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.\nIf you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us.\nTo our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.\nI will address it swiftly and vigorously.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation.\nI trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.\nTo our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.\nYou are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.\nThis is to keep you very close to God.\nIn addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.\nIn obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do.\nAnd by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.\nGod will give you the graces to do so.\nAsk Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.\nAnd if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.\nTo the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.\nIt will be addressed quickly and justly.\nIf you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.\nSuch actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person.\nAgain, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.\nFurthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;\nI will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;\nI will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.\nFailure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;\nI will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;\nI ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.\nI promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;\nI ask everyone reading this to pray.\nPray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers.\nPray for our seminarians.\nAnd pray for yourselves and your families.\nWe must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and\nFinally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.\nI will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes.\nIn addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same.\nSome sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.\nThis letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.\nMore than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.\nWe must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.\nWe must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.\nWe must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.\nAgain, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity.\nI stand with them.\nI don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.\nBut I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”\nFaithfully yours in the Lord,\nMost Rev.\nRobert C. Morlino\nBishop of Madison\nThis text first appeared in the Madison Catholic Herald.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Et Tu, Benedict?\n(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)\n\nRecently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.\nI declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.\nIt’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.\nThe consequences of that act have been so outlandish – even for people who are mostly OK with Francis – that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.\nEditor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.\nDario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.\nIn no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that “there is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.” Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.\nOur thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.\nMJM\nIn fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope – a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the “filth” in the Curia and throughout the church – suddenly just decide to quit?\nWhy would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?\nAt the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.\nThese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.\nWe cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.\nCould we have been wrong about him?\nAnd if so, could we have been this wrong?\nFor reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, “I’m tired.” There was some implication that he didn’t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn’t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.\nThe trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.\nOf all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.\nAnd since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?\nThis man whom we had believed a “champion of orthodoxy,” whom we thought we knew.\nError, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.\nHow content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.\nAfter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: “Your goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.” Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn’t lie:\nSo strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.\nBut this is not what we see.\nThere he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.\n“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?\nWhy, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?\nIf it is a deception, why participate in it?\nIn fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.\nSome insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.\nBut we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.\nAnd indeed, far from being an isolated “prisoner of the Vatican,” Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.\nWe have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.\nThere’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.\nAll the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:\nWhy did you resign?\nRatzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”\nIf you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?\nRatzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”\nWhy do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?\nRatzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”\nAnd where did this “emeritus” business come from?\nDoes it have any precedent in Catholic history?\nWhat does it mean canonically and doctrinally?\nRatzinger: “…”\nWhat was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided “munus” – with an active member and a “contemplative member”?\nDoesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?\nRatzinger: “…”\nAnd perhaps most agonising of all: “How can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?”\nA few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.\nSteve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:\nFive years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.\nAnd through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.\nYou may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.\nHe walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.\nAnd still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.\nWho is the real Joseph Ratzinger?\nI have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.\nI think we made the mistake of believing the press.\nWe were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.\nWe failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.\nWhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a “progressive,” as the term was understood in 1962.\nThis reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.\nFrings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.\nAfter this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.\nThis was done, over Ottaviani’s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French “progressives” who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.\nIt has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger – the maverick “progressive” academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary – who wrote that speech.\nCardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:\n“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.\nFrings, Archbishop of Cologne.\nBlind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.\nNow then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.\nDespite a reply by Card.\nOttaviani, Frings sustained his critique.\n\n“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.\n\n“Card.\nSeper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.\nRatzinger, who did not change, continues it.”\nRatzinger’s reputation as a “progressive” is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.\nIt went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.\nIn his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:\nThe duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.\n\nThis implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.\nNeither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.\nHence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.\nIt was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.\nBut to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.\nHis was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.\nHow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had “destroyed” and would gain the media-generated reputation as an “arch-conservative”.\nAnd it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.\nWith the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?\nWhat did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism – that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?\nWhat did “silencing” by Ratzinger’s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity “priest-theologian,” courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?\nKung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?\nCan we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?\nPrecious few.\nBut we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith – academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world – with never a peep of protest from Rome.\nMoreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the “arch-conservative” John Paul II and the “Rottweiler” Benedict XVI pontificates.\nWhy did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?\nIs it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?\nThe “progressive” destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet “arch-conservative”…\nIndeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.\nHe was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.\nPerhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.\nPerhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called “progressive” in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a “champion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy” by 2005.\nIs this why he resigned?\nIs it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?\nPerhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the “liberal” European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the “Sankt Gallen Mafia” that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.\nFausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.\nMartini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.\nApparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.\nBy 2012, this had proved impossible.\nWhy would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini – the “godfather” of the “liberal wing” of European Catholicism?\nI think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.\nThey were esteemed academic colleagues.\nThey were brothers of the episcopate.\nThey were members of the club.\nAny appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.\nWhy wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?\nWhy is Walter Kasper a cardinal?\nOne of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these “conservative” prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.\nIt beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.\nWhen, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.\nJorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the “ultra-liberal” “wing” of the post-Vatican II Church.\nIn an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.\nThe monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.\nThis is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.\nJansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another “Sankt Gallen” member.\nThis was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.\nBut that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn’t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?\nWhy was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?\nKasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.\nBut it’s a simple truth: he’s a heretic.\nEveryone knows he’s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.\nAfter openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.\nRemember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.\nBut he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.\nNor was he removed from places of influence.\nFar from it.\nIn 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.\nIn 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.\nIn 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.\nThen Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.\nAnd, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger’s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.\nAs Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,\nCardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.\nBut since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.\n(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)\nExcuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.\nIs it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?\nCardinal Ratzinger, Pope “Emeritus” Benedict – whatever you want to call yourself – I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?\nWhy is he still a bishop?\nWhy is he still allowed to call himself a “Catholic theologian”?\nWhy did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?\nDoesn’t anyone else want to know this?\nDon’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?\nWhy was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?\nWhy a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated?\nWhat are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?\nMy own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.\nFor fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church.\nWhy have we so often seen these men – compromised intellectually and morally – elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?\nThe end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”\nThe New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.\nMaike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation – in which each, of the so-called “Sankt Gallen Mafia” prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: “It was characteristic of the church’s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.”\nWhen journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being – as his Wikipedia page puts it – “one of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.” And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we’re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times.\nThere’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.\nSteve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole “emeritus pope” charade was an error: “I think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn’t have.” In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error.\nBy playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.\nBecause of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church’s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a “big umbrella” with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal “taste” …that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.\nThis schizophrenia is the model under which “conservatives” have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a “conservative champion of orthodoxy.” And what has this achieved?\nIt created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.\nAnd just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.\nAs it had to.\nThey, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.\nAnd their New Church is the only one left.\nFor five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don’t talk about it, there isn’t a problem.\nOttaviani’s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church – and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger.\nWe had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.\nOne of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era.\nWe were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the “New Springtime of Vatican II,” while we watched these wolves in shepherds’ clothing eating the sheep.\nNow we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness.\nFor those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result.\nThis pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Et Tu, Benedict?\n(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)\n\nRecently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.\nI declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.\nIt’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.\nThe consequences of that act have been so outlandish – even for people who are mostly OK with Francis – that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.\nEditor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.\nDario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.\nIn no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that “there is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.” Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.\nOur thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.\nMJM\nIn fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope – a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the “filth” in the Curia and throughout the church – suddenly just decide to quit?\nWhy would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?\nAt the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.\nThese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.\nWe cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.\nCould we have been wrong about him?\nAnd if so, could we have been this wrong?\nFor reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, “I’m tired.” There was some implication that he didn’t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn’t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.\nThe trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.\nOf all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.\nAnd since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?\nThis man whom we had believed a “champion of orthodoxy,” whom we thought we knew.\nError, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.\nHow content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.\nAfter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: “Your goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.” Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn’t lie:\nSo strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.\nBut this is not what we see.\nThere he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.\n“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?\nWhy, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?\nIf it is a deception, why participate in it?\nIn fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.\nSome insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.\nBut we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.\nAnd indeed, far from being an isolated “prisoner of the Vatican,” Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.\nWe have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.\nThere’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.\nAll the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:\nWhy did you resign?\nRatzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”\nIf you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?\nRatzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”\nWhy do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?\nRatzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”\nAnd where did this “emeritus” business come from?\nDoes it have any precedent in Catholic history?\nWhat does it mean canonically and doctrinally?\nRatzinger: “…”\nWhat was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided “munus” – with an active member and a “contemplative member”?\nDoesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?\nRatzinger: “…”\nAnd perhaps most agonising of all: “How can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?”\nA few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.\nSteve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:\nFive years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.\nAnd through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.\nYou may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.\nHe walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.\nAnd still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.\nWho is the real Joseph Ratzinger?\nI have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.\nI think we made the mistake of believing the press.\nWe were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.\nWe failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.\nWhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a “progressive,” as the term was understood in 1962.\nThis reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.\nFrings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.\nAfter this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.\nThis was done, over Ottaviani’s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French “progressives” who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.\nIt has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger – the maverick “progressive” academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary – who wrote that speech.\nCardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:\n“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.\nFrings, Archbishop of Cologne.\nBlind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.\nNow then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.\nDespite a reply by Card.\nOttaviani, Frings sustained his critique.\n\n“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.\n\n“Card.\nSeper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.\nRatzinger, who did not change, continues it.”\nRatzinger’s reputation as a “progressive” is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.\nIt went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.\nIn his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:\nThe duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.\n\nThis implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.\nNeither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.\nHence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.\nIt was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.\nBut to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.\nHis was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.\nHow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had “destroyed” and would gain the media-generated reputation as an “arch-conservative”.\nAnd it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.\nWith the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?\nWhat did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism – that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?\nWhat did “silencing” by Ratzinger’s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity “priest-theologian,” courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?\nKung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?\nCan we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?\nPrecious few.\nBut we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith – academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world – with never a peep of protest from Rome.\nMoreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the “arch-conservative” John Paul II and the “Rottweiler” Benedict XVI pontificates.\nWhy did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?\nIs it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?\nThe “progressive” destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet “arch-conservative”…\nIndeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.\nHe was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.\nPerhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.\nPerhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called “progressive” in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a “champion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy” by 2005.\nIs this why he resigned?\nIs it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?\nPerhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the “liberal” European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the “Sankt Gallen Mafia” that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.\nFausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.\nMartini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.\nApparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.\nBy 2012, this had proved impossible.\nWhy would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini – the “godfather” of the “liberal wing” of European Catholicism?\nI think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.\nThey were esteemed academic colleagues.\nThey were brothers of the episcopate.\nThey were members of the club.\nAny appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.\nWhy wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?\nWhy is Walter Kasper a cardinal?\nOne of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these “conservative” prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.\nIt beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.\nWhen, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.\nJorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the “ultra-liberal” “wing” of the post-Vatican II Church.\nIn an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.\nThe monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.\nThis is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.\nJansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another “Sankt Gallen” member.\nThis was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.\nBut that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn’t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?\nWhy was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?\nKasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.\nBut it’s a simple truth: he’s a heretic.\nEveryone knows he’s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.\nAfter openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.\nRemember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.\nBut he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.\nNor was he removed from places of influence.\nFar from it.\nIn 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.\nIn 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.\nIn 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.\nThen Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.\nAnd, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger’s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.\nAs Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,\nCardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.\nBut since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.\n(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)\nExcuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.\nIs it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?\nCardinal Ratzinger, Pope “Emeritus” Benedict – whatever you want to call yourself – I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?\nWhy is he still a bishop?\nWhy is he still allowed to call himself a “Catholic theologian”?\nWhy did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?\nDoesn’t anyone else want to know this?\nDon’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?\nWhy was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?\nWhy a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated?\nWhat are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?\nMy own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.\nFor fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church.\nWhy have we so often seen these men – compromised intellectually and morally – elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?\nThe end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”\nThe New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.\nMaike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation – in which each, of the so-called “Sankt Gallen Mafia” prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: “It was characteristic of the church’s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.”\nWhen journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being – as his Wikipedia page puts it – “one of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.” And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we’re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times.\nThere’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.\nSteve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole “emeritus pope” charade was an error: “I think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn’t have.” In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error.\nBy playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.\nBecause of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church’s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a “big umbrella” with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal “taste” …that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.\nThis schizophrenia is the model under which “conservatives” have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a “conservative champion of orthodoxy.” And what has this achieved?\nIt created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.\nAnd just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.\nAs it had to.\nThey, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.\nAnd their New Church is the only one left.\nFor five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don’t talk about it, there isn’t a problem.\nOttaviani’s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church – and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger.\nWe had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.\nOne of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era.\nWe were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the “New Springtime of Vatican II,” while we watched these wolves in shepherds’ clothing eating the sheep.\nNow we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness.\nFor those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result.\nThis pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Et Tu, Benedict?\n(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)\n\nRecently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.\nI declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.\nIt’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.\nThe consequences of that act have been so outlandish – even for people who are mostly OK with Francis – that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.\nEditor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.\nDario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.\nIn no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that “there is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.” Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.\nOur thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.\nMJM\nIn fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope – a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the “filth” in the Curia and throughout the church – suddenly just decide to quit?\nWhy would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?\nAt the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.\nThese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.\nWe cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.\nCould we have been wrong about him?\nAnd if so, could we have been this wrong?\nFor reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, “I’m tired.” There was some implication that he didn’t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn’t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.\nThe trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.\nOf all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.\nAnd since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?\nThis man whom we had believed a “champion of orthodoxy,” whom we thought we knew.\nError, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.\nHow content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.\nAfter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: “Your goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.” Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn’t lie:\nSo strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.\nBut this is not what we see.\nThere he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.\n“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?\nWhy, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?\nIf it is a deception, why participate in it?\nIn fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.\nSome insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.\nBut we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.\nAnd indeed, far from being an isolated “prisoner of the Vatican,” Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.\nWe have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.\nThere’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.\nAll the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:\nWhy did you resign?\nRatzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”\nIf you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?\nRatzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”\nWhy do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?\nRatzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”\nAnd where did this “emeritus” business come from?\nDoes it have any precedent in Catholic history?\nWhat does it mean canonically and doctrinally?\nRatzinger: “…”\nWhat was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided “munus” – with an active member and a “contemplative member”?\nDoesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?\nRatzinger: “…”\nAnd perhaps most agonising of all: “How can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?”\nA few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.\nSteve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:\nFive years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.\nAnd through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.\nYou may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.\nHe walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.\nAnd still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.\nWho is the real Joseph Ratzinger?\nI have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.\nI think we made the mistake of believing the press.\nWe were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.\nWe failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.\nWhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a “progressive,” as the term was understood in 1962.\nThis reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.\nFrings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.\nAfter this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.\nThis was done, over Ottaviani’s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French “progressives” who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.\nIt has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger – the maverick “progressive” academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary – who wrote that speech.\nCardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:\n“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.\nFrings, Archbishop of Cologne.\nBlind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.\nNow then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.\nDespite a reply by Card.\nOttaviani, Frings sustained his critique.\n\n“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.\n\n“Card.\nSeper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.\nRatzinger, who did not change, continues it.”\nRatzinger’s reputation as a “progressive” is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.\nIt went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.\nIn his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:\nThe duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.\n\nThis implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.\nNeither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.\nHence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.\nIt was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.\nBut to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.\nHis was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.\nHow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had “destroyed” and would gain the media-generated reputation as an “arch-conservative”.\nAnd it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.\nWith the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?\nWhat did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism – that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?\nWhat did “silencing” by Ratzinger’s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity “priest-theologian,” courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?\nKung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?\nCan we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?\nPrecious few.\nBut we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith – academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world – with never a peep of protest from Rome.\nMoreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the “arch-conservative” John Paul II and the “Rottweiler” Benedict XVI pontificates.\nWhy did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?\nIs it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?\nThe “progressive” destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet “arch-conservative”…\nIndeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.\nHe was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.\nPerhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.\nPerhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called “progressive” in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a “champion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy” by 2005.\nIs this why he resigned?\nIs it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?\nPerhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the “liberal” European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the “Sankt Gallen Mafia” that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.\nFausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.\nMartini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.\nApparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.\nBy 2012, this had proved impossible.\nWhy would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini – the “godfather” of the “liberal wing” of European Catholicism?\nI think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.\nThey were esteemed academic colleagues.\nThey were brothers of the episcopate.\nThey were members of the club.\nAny appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.\nWhy wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?\nWhy is Walter Kasper a cardinal?\nOne of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these “conservative” prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.\nIt beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.\nWhen, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.\nJorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the “ultra-liberal” “wing” of the post-Vatican II Church.\nIn an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.\nThe monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.\nThis is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.\nJansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another “Sankt Gallen” member.\nThis was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.\nBut that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn’t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?\nWhy was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?\nKasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.\nBut it’s a simple truth: he’s a heretic.\nEveryone knows he’s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.\nAfter openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.\nRemember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.\nBut he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.\nNor was he removed from places of influence.\nFar from it.\nIn 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.\nIn 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.\nIn 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.\nThen Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.\nAnd, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger’s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.\nAs Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,\nCardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.\nBut since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.\n(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)\nExcuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.\nIs it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?\nCardinal Ratzinger, Pope “Emeritus” Benedict – whatever you want to call yourself – I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?\nWhy is he still a bishop?\nWhy is he still allowed to call himself a “Catholic theologian”?\nWhy did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?\nDoesn’t anyone else want to know this?\nDon’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?\nWhy was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?\nWhy a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated?\nWhat are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?\nMy own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.\nFor fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church.\nWhy have we so often seen these men – compromised intellectually and morally – elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?\nThe end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”\nThe New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.\nMaike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation – in which each, of the so-called “Sankt Gallen Mafia” prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: “It was characteristic of the church’s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.”\nWhen journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being – as his Wikipedia page puts it – “one of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.” And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we’re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times.\nThere’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.\nSteve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole “emeritus pope” charade was an error: “I think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn’t have.” In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error.\nBy playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.\nBecause of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church’s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a “big umbrella” with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal “taste” …that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.\nThis schizophrenia is the model under which “conservatives” have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a “conservative champion of orthodoxy.” And what has this achieved?\nIt created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.\nAnd just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.\nAs it had to.\nThey, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.\nAnd their New Church is the only one left.\nFor five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don’t talk about it, there isn’t a problem.\nOttaviani’s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church – and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger.\nWe had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.\nOne of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era.\nWe were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the “New Springtime of Vatican II,” while we watched these wolves in shepherds’ clothing eating the sheep.\nNow we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness.\nFor those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result.\nThis pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.\n\n",

against Brett Kavanaugh — outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — are substantial and serious.\nShe claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes.\nHere’s the core of her story:\nWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.\nWhen she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\n“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California.\n“He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.\nShe said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.\nDo not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault.\nI went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale.\nThis isn’t “boys will be boys.” Actions have consequences, and it’s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this — even a long time ago — he has to remain “merely” a judge on the D.C.\nCircuit Court of Appeals.\nSince Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot.\nAt the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.\nYet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred.\nWe don’t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court.\nI have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who’s accused of misconduct.\nIs it more likely than not that the allegation is true?\nGiven the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment.\nI believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.\nI believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.\nBut the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.\nSo far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment.\nHere’s why:\nFirst, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration.\nDid the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?\nWith Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration.\nHere, there was not.\nAccording to the Washington Post, “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.”\nThat’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.\nBut even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.\nThey actually contradict her story on a key detail.\nAccording to the Post, “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part.\nFord said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh’s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.\nThose are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect.\nAs a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails.\nJuries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes — after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn’t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome.\nAt least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.\nIf there were only four boys there, who were the other two?\nLet’s hear from them.\nIn fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.\nYet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party?\nWould they remember any details at all?\nIf someone saw Kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party, that would obviously bolster Ford’s account.\nIf another attendee says, “He was totally sober and with me the whole time,” that helps Kavanaugh.\nBut the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person….\n\n",

postpone the vote on Kavanaugh.\nEstablishment Republicans are racing for the exits.\nBut over what?\nAn unprovable accusation from decades ago that the accuser said nothing about until years later, and that is uncorroborated by any other testimony or by the evidence of any similar behavior on Kavanaugh’s part.\nThis is clearly a set-up (Christine Ford is also a far-left Democrat operative) designed to derail the nomination of a good man.\nThere is no low to which the Democrats will not sink to attain their nefarious goals of stopping the President from strengthening America and protecting Americans.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n“Weighing the Allegations against Brett Kavanaugh,” by David French, National Review, September 16, 2018:\nThey’re serious but not solid.\nThe allegations against Brett Kavanaugh — outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — are substantial and serious.\nShe claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes.\nHere’s the core of her story:\nWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.\nWhen she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\n“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California.\n“He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.\nShe said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.\nDo not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault.\nI went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale.\nThis isn’t “boys will be boys.” Actions have consequences, and it’s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this — even a long time ago — he has to remain “merely” a judge on the D.C.\nCircuit Court of Appeals.\nSince Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot.\nAt the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.\nYet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred.\nWe don’t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court.\nI have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who’s accused of misconduct.\nIs it more likely than not that the allegation is true?\nGiven the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment.\nI believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.\nI believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.\nBut the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.\nSo far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment.\nHere’s why:\nFirst, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration.\nDid the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?\nWith Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration.\nHere, there was not.\nAccording to the Washington Post, “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.”\nThat’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.\nBut even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.\nThey actually contradict her story on a key detail.\nAccording to the Post, “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part.\nFord said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh’s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.\nThose are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect.\nAs a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails.\nJuries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes — after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn’t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome.\nAt least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.\nIf there were only four boys there, who were the other two?\nLet’s hear from them.\nIn fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.\nYet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party?\nWould they remember any details at all?\nIf someone saw Kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party, that would obviously bolster Ford’s account.\nIf another attendee says, “He was totally sober and with me the whole time,” that helps Kavanaugh.\nBut the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person….\n\n",

            "text_intent": "No Justice for Kate Steinle\n\nA San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015.\nThe jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm.\nFor Garcia’s Zarate’s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump.\n“For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,” Gonzalez said after the verdict, “the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States.\nLet me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.”\n“From day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,” added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte.\n“It was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others.\nI believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nAlex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.\n“We’re just shocked — saddened and shocked ... that’s about it,” Jim Steinle, Kate’s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n“There’s no other way you can coin it.\nJustice was rendered, but it was not served.” Kate’s brother Brad was “stunned that they couldn’t even get him on using the weapon.”\nAttorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter.\nThe verdict, Wohl said, was “an utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.”\nConservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was “horrifying.\n.\n.\nPolitics trumps evidence in California once again.” For Jeff Sessions San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy “led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.” According to the Attorney General’s statement, the Justice Department “will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens.”\nFor his part, President Trump tweeted: “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!\nNo wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”\nMexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times.\nIn 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation.\nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.\nOn July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.\nThe Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers.\nDuring the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate’s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution.\nAs Gonzalez argued, “If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?”\nThat sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family.\nThe felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.\nSince Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.\nSan Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE

            "text_intent": "No Justice for Kate Steinle\n\nA San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015.\nThe jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm.\nFor Garcia’s Zarate’s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump.\n“For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,” Gonzalez said after the verdict, “the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States.\nLet me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.”\n“From day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,” added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte.\n“It was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others.\nI believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nAlex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.\n“We’re just shocked — saddened and shocked ... that’s about it,” Jim Steinle, Kate’s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n“There’s no other way you can coin it.\nJustice was rendered, but it was not served.” Kate’s brother Brad was “stunned that they couldn’t even get him on using the weapon.”\nAttorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter.\nThe verdict, Wohl said, was “an utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.”\nConservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was “horrifying.\n.\n.\nPolitics trumps evidence in California once again.” For Jeff Sessions San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy “led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.” According to the Attorney General’s statement, the Justice Department “will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens.”\nFor his part, President Trump tweeted: “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!\nNo wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”\nMexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times.\nIn 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation.\nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.\nOn July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.\nThe Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers.\nDuring the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate’s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution.\nAs Gonzalez argued, “If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?”\nThat sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family.\nThe felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.\nSince Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.\nSan Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.\nShould that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law.\nHe has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class.\nJose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight.\nWhen that happens, the killer’s public defender will call it a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”\nIn San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of “no justice, no peace.”\n\n",

p. 133).\nWhence the bracketed interpolation “at the shrine”?\nWills doesn’t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself.\nBy adding “at the shrine” to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.\nHe ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims.\nThe prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way:\nThe worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator.\nTo eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah.\nWills doesn’t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them.\nLikewise, when he claims that the Qur’an has “not a thing” to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur’an is one of the sources of Sharia.\nThe Qur’an’s declarations that a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who “wage war against Allah and his messenger” are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions.\nBecause these stipulations are found in the Qur’an, they cannot be questioned or set aside.\nThroughout his book, Wills’ assurances that the Qur’an is not really as bad as “right-wing Islamophobes” say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny.\nAgain and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case.\nHe asks why the Qur’an is “so ferocious to ‘hypocrites’ and apostates” (p. 124).\nThen he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that “if we sin again on purpose” there is “only a terrifying judgment to come” (p. 126).\nWills concludes: “The Qur’an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God’s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness” (p. 126).\nThat sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur’an is more merciful than the New Testament.\nUntil one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur’an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur’anic passage on this topic:\ntake our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThey wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike.\nSo do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah.\nBut if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper (4:89).\nTo “emigrate in the cause of Allah” is to leave one’s home and join up with the Muslims.\nThis passage envisions some of the disbelievers becoming Muslim, and then turning away again, whereupon the Muslims are told to “kill them wherever you find them.” God’s inexhaustible mercy, indeed.\nWills’ peaceful fantasy Qur’an raises one massive question that the author does not and cannot answer: if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?\nThe Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur’an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book’s core tenets.\nISIS quoted the Qur’an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain;

p. 133).\nWhence the bracketed interpolation “at the shrine”?\nWills doesn’t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself.\nBy adding “at the shrine” to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.\nHe ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims.\nThe prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way:\nThe worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator.\nTo eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah.\nWills doesn’t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them.\nLikewise, when he claims that the Qur’an has “not a thing” to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur’an is one of the sources of Sharia.\nThe Qur’an’s declarations that a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who “wage war against Allah and his messenger” are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions.\nBecause these stipulations are found in the Qur’an, they cannot be questioned or set aside.\nThroughout his book, Wills’ assurances that the Qur’an is not really as bad as “right-wing Islamophobes” say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny.\nAgain and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case.\nHe asks why the Qur’an is “so ferocious to ‘hypocrites’ and apostates” (p. 124).\nThen he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that “if we sin again on purpose” there is “only a terrifying judgment to come” (p. 126).\nWills concludes: “The Qur’an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God’s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness” (p. 126).\nThat sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur’an is more merciful than the New Testament.\nUntil one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur’an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur’anic passage on this topic:\ntake our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThey wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike.\nSo do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah.\nBut if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper (4:89).\nTo “emigrate in the cause of Allah” is to leave one’s home and join up with the Muslims.\nThis passage envisions some of the disbelievers becoming Muslim, and then turning away again, whereupon the Muslims are told to “kill them wherever you find them.” God’s inexhaustible mercy, indeed.\nWills’ peaceful fantasy Qur’an raises one massive question that the author does not and cannot answer: if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?\nThe Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur’an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book’s core tenets.\nISIS quoted the Qur’an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur’an-based tax, cf.\nQur’an 9:29); in justifying the execution of accused spies; and in its various videos.\nISIS also awarded $10,000 prizes and sex slaves in Qur’an memorization contests.\nOne of its underground lairs was found littered with weapons and copies of the Qur’an.\nChildren in the Islamic State study the Qur’an and get weapons training.\nOne Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur’an led him to join the Islamic State.\nA Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur’an.\nAn Islamic State propagandist’s parents said of him: “Our son is a devout Muslim.\nHe had learnt the Quran by heart.” A Muslim politician from Jordan said that the Islamic State’s “doctrine stems from the Qur’an and Sunnah.”\nHow would Garry Wills explain all that?\nHe can’t; he has just explained all Qur’anic violence and intolerance away, leaving the manifest fact that all too many Muslims worldwide think that the Qur’an says exactly what he claims it does not say an unanswered conundrum.\nWills’ naïve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view of the Qur’an, of course, accords with that of his fellow Leftist Catholic, Pope Francis.\nFrancis has proclaimedpreposterously that “authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.” Wills’ book accords well with the present-day Catholic Church’s head-in-the-sand posture toward Qur’an-based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East.\nIt isn’t remotely accurate, but it feels good, and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today, that seems to be all that matters.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n\n",

see Assange in jail forever or even executed.\nHow do you respond to journalists acting like prosecutors, some of whom used his material to do stories?\nThis is a terrible time for journalism.\nJP: You are absolutely right: It is a terrible time for journalism.\nI have never known anything quite like it in my career.\nThat said, it is not new.\nThere has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media.\nIt has always existed, particularly in the United States.\nThe Pulitzer Prize this year was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for witch-hunting around Russia-gate!\nThey were praised for “how deeply sourced their investigations were.” Their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious Russian intervention in the 2016 election.\nLike Webb\nThe Julian Assange case reminds me of the Gary Webb case.\nBob Parry was one of Gary Webb’s few supporters in the media.\nWebb’s “Dark Alliance” series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the CIA.\nLater Webb was hounded by fellow journalists and, unable to find work, he eventually committed suicide.\nThe CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him.\nNow, Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life.\nHis resilience is remarkable.\nBut he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering.\nProbably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations—like The New York Times, which published the WikiLeaks “War Logs” and “Cablegate,” The Washington Post and The Guardian, which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting Julian.\nThe Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden.\nBut their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong.\nIt was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety.\nProfessionally, I find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things I have seen in my career.\nThe persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks.\nOne of Assange’s great tormentors, The Guardian‘s Luke Harding, made a great deal of money with a Hollywood version of a book that he and David Lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source.\nI suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this.\nMy understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed.\nThey realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie.\nDB: One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election, that it was a hack through Julian Assange.\nAny serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated.\nAnd yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders…this is not a part of the story!\nEight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia\nJP: What happened to Sanders and the way that he was rolled by the Clinton organization, everybody knows that this is the story.\nAnd now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks!\nThere’s a kind of farcical element to this.\nI mean, none of this came from the Russians.\nThat WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous.\nWikiLeaks published about 800,000 major disclosures about Russia, some of them extremely critical of the Russian government.\nIf you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it, they will publish no matter who you are, be they the United States or Russia.\nDB: Randy Credico, because of his work and his decision to devote a very high-profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange, recently found himself under attack.\nHe went to the White House Press Roast and, after having a nice discussion with Congressman Schiff, he yelled out “What about Julian Assange?” The room was packed full of reporters but Randy was attacked and dragged out.\nIt was if everyone there was embarrassed to recognize that one of their brethren was being brutalized.\nJP: Randy shouted some truth.\nIt is very similar to what happened to Ray McGovern.\nRay is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled.\nI might suggest he is a renegade now.\nDB: It was hysterical to watch these four armed guards who kept shouting “Stop resisting, stop resisting!” and they are beating the hell out of him!\nJP: I thought the image of Ray being hauled off was particularly telling.\nThese four overweight, obviously ill-trained young men manhandling Ray, who is 78 years old.\nThere was something highly emblematic about that for me.\nHe stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture.\nIt is both shocking and surreal, which of course the Julian Assange case is as well.\nBut real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth.\nThere is so much collusion now, with all these dark and menacing developments.\nIt is almost as if the word “journalism” is becoming blighted.\nDB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel.\nThen the word “collusion” is quite appropriate.\nJP:That’s the ultimate collusion.\nBut that’s collusion with silence.\nNever has there been a collusion like the one between the U.S. and Israel.\nIt suggests another word and that is “immunity.” It has a moral immunity, a cultural immunity, a geopolitical immunity, a legal immunity, and certainly a media immunity.\nWe see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.\nIsrael has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return.\nIn the media these were described as “clashes.” Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people.\nA rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted.\nAll the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East.\nDB: What would you say have been the contributions that Julian Assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism?\nWhere does he come into the picture?\nJP:I think it comes down to information.\nIf you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret.\nThe right to know what governments are doing in our name—on our behalf or to our detriment—is our moral right.\nJulian feels very passionately about this.\nThere were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation.\nThere were times when I said to him, “Why don’t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it?” Of course, I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was “no.” The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks, particularly in recent years, has amounted to an extraordinary public service.\nI was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region.\nThis was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup.\nIt detailed how subversion should work.\nOf course, they dressed it up as human rights work and so on.\nI was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela.\nIt also reminds us that so-called “meddling” by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense.\nThe word “meddling” doesn’t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.\nIt is intervention in another country’s affairs.\nWikiLeaks has done that all over the world.\nIt has given people the information they have a right to have.\nThey had a right to find out from the so-called “War Logs” the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThey had a right to find out about Cablegate.\nThat’s when, on Clinton’s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers.\nYou can see why Julian made enemies.\nBut he should also have made a huge number of friends.\nThis is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise.\nI think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression “right to know.” This must explain why he is attacked so much, because that is so threatening.\nThe enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban, it is us.\nDB: And who can forget the release of the “collateral murder” footage by Chelsea Manning?\nJP: That kind of thing is not uncommon.\nVietnam was meant to be the open war but really it wasn’t.\nThere weren’t the cameras around.\nIt is indeed shocking information but it informs people, and we have Chelsea Manning’s courage to thank for that.\nDB: Yes, and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement.\nThey want to prosecute Assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in Congress, but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?\nThere is no end of horrific examples of what passes for journalism, in contrast to the amazing contribution that Julian Assange has made.\nClick here to listen to this interview.\n\n",

apply to the kind of action implied in this document.\nIt is intervention in another country’s affairs.\nWikiLeaks has done that all over the world.\nIt has given people the information they have a

Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $1.49 Buy New $3.70 (as of 06:30 EDT - Details)\nDennis Bernstein: We continue our discussion of the case of Julian Assange, now in the Ecuadorian embassy in Great Britain.\nJohn Pilger, it is great to talk to you again.\nBut it is a profound tragedy, John, the way they are treating Julian Assange, this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalists have depended on in the past.\nHe has been totally left out in the cold to fend for himself.\nJohn Pilger: I have never known anything like it.\nThere is a kind of eerie silence around the Julian Assange case.\nJulian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days.\nHe is cut off from the very tools of his trade, visitors aren’t allowed.\nI was in London recently and I couldn’t see him, although I spoke to people who had seen him.\nRafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture.\nIt was Correa’s government that gave Julian political refuge, which has been betrayed now by his successor, the government led by Lenin Moreno, which is back to sucking up to the United States in the time-honored way, with Julian as the pawn and victim.\nShould be a ‘Constitutional Hero’\nBut really it comes down to the British government.\nAlthough he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality, his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government.\nThe United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear.\nBritain took part in an investigation which determined that Julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him.\nIt is very good that you are doing this, Dennis, because even in the media outside the mainstream, there is this silence about Julian.\nThe streets outside the embassy are virtually empty, whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you.\nThe principles involved in this case are absolutely clear-cut.\nNumber one is justice.\nThe injustice done to this man is legion, both in terms of the bogus Swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can’t leave without being arrested, extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole.\nBut it is also about freedom of speech, about our right to know, which is enshrined in the United States Constitution.\nIf the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero, actually.\nInstead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage!\nIt’s so ridiculous.That is the situation as I see it, Dennis.\nIt is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly.\nDB: His journalistic brethren are sounding like his prosecutors.\nThey want to get behind Russia-gate freaks like Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo, who would like to see Assange in jail forever or even executed.\nHow do you respond to journalists acting like prosecutors, some of whom used his material to do stories?\nThis is a terrible time for journalism.\nJP: You are absolutely right: It is a terrible time for journalism.\nI have never known anything quite like it in my career.\nThat said, it is not new.\nThere has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media.\nIt has always existed, particularly in the United States.\nThe Pulitzer Prize this year was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for witch-hunting around Russia-gate!\nThey were praised for “how deeply sourced their investigations were.” Their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious Russian intervention in the 2016 election.\nLike Webb\nThe Julian Assange case reminds me of the Gary Webb case.\nBob Parry was one of Gary Webb’s few supporters in the media.\nWebb’s “Dark Alliance” series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the CIA.\nLater Webb was hounded by fellow journalists and, unable to find work, he eventually committed suicide.\nThe CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him.\nNow, Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life.\nHis resilience is remarkable.\nBut he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering.\nProbably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations—like The New York Times, which published the WikiLeaks “War Logs” and “Cablegate,” The Washington Post and The Guardian, which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting Julian.\nThe Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden.\nBut their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong.\nIt was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety.\nProfessionally, I find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things I have seen in my career.\nThe persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks.\nOne of Assange’s great tormentors, The Guardian‘s Luke Harding, made a great deal of money with a Hollywood version of a book that he and David Lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source.\nI suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this.\nMy understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed.\nThey realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie.\nDB: One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election, that it was a hack through Julian Assange.\nAny serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated.\nAnd yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders…this is not a part of the story!\nEight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia\nJP: What happened to Sanders and the way that he was rolled by the Clinton organization, everybody knows that this is the story.\nAnd now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks!\nThere’s a kind of farcical element to this.\nI mean, none of this came from the Russians.\nThat WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous.\nWikiLeaks published about 800,000 major disclosures about Russia, some of them extremely critical of the Russian government.\nIf you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it, they will publish no matter who you are, be they the United States or Russia.\nDB: Randy Credico, because of his work and his decision to devote a very high-profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange, recently found himself under attack.\nHe went to the White House Press Roast and, after

            "text_intent": "﻿Communion to Adulterers Promulgated as \"Authentic Magisterium\"\n\nLast week, Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS)—the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See—published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin.\nIf papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large.\nConcerning these guidelines that allow \"the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist\" in \"complex circumstances\" where \"limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt\" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter:\n\"The document is very good and completely explains the meaning of chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia.\nThere are no other interpretations.\"\nUntil now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an \"Apostolic Letter,\" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State.\nThe rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents—the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines—to bear the character of his \"authentic Magisterium,\" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website.\nHence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when \"concrete circumstances\" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared \"magisterial\" by the Holy See.\nThe problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration.\nSt. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: \"If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.\"\nThe fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it.\nCardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows:\nRescript \"from an Audience with His Holiness\"\nThe Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium.\nFrom the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017\nPietro Card.\nParolin\nSecretary of State\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: \"Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals.\nSome rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g.\nthe interpretation of a law.\"\nIt appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals.\nPope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it?\nAs reported in The Dictator Pope—a remarkable new book which provides an inside look at the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history—English Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor who was largely responsible for the vote canvassing behind Francis' election told journalist Paul Valley in 2013, \"Four years of Bergoglio would be enough to change things.\"\nEach day, we see new evidence that this might have been a gross understatement.\nWe shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare \"ex-cathedra\" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as \"extraordinary magisterium.\"\nShould this happen, the Mystical Body would then be without its head.\nIn an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to \"formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.\"\nBurke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: \"In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact.\"\n\n",

            "text_intent": "National Data | December Jobs—TRUMP EFFECT!\nAmerican Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE!\n| Articles\n\n)\nForget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump’s latest DACA dalliance —the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work.\nDecember marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year.\nSimultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September.\nAnd, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low.\nWhat started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreign-born population of working age has turned into an outright retreat.\nThis is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the Obama Regime, which saw year-over-year increases in immigrant working-age population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually, and which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway.\nAccording to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016—a decline of 0.18%.\nThis follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November.\nNot since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months—but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding.\nThis makes the Trump Era immigrant workforce decline especially striking.\nNote that this is a net figure.\nThe year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in.\nAbout 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n[U.S.\nImmigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period—the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants.\nThis helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).\nThe additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers’ immigrant status (but not their legal status).\nThe Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month—well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey.\nIn December 2017:\nImmigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93%\nNative-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 – up 0.27%\nThe immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9.\nThe native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0..\nThe New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment

Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period—the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants.\nThis helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).\nThe additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers’ immigrant status (but not their legal status).\nThe Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month—well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey.\nIn December 2017:\nImmigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93%\nNative-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 – up 0.27%\nThe immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to

Joe Donnelly, would lead to Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) becoming the Senate Majority leader should the Democrats regain control of the Senate.\nThe president also pointed out that Donnelly had opposed tax cuts and joined with his fellow Democrats in attacking and voting against Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\"The people of Indiana do not have a one-week memory,” said Trump.\n“That was a disgrace what we watched up there.\"\nAdditionally, Trump said that Donnelly voted to provide free health care to illegal aliens and sponsored Senator Dianne Feinstein's (D-CA) \"Open Borders Bill.\"\nWhile some don't believe that Trump's base is all that energized, it seems pretty energetic to me and attacks on conservatives on social media and in search engine results have only furthered their outrage at the establishment, both Democrat and Republican.\nWe're just days away from seeing how things turn out.\nThere's a part of me that thinks this may actually turn out to be one of the biggest turnouts for a mid-term election that we've ever seen, but that's just my gut feeling.\nOn Tuesday, we'll know for sure.\nI don't know about you, but I didn't actually like hearing the words \"Speaker Paul Ryan.\"\nI certainly don't want to hear \"Speaker Pelosi,\" again.\n\n",

Go Out & Vote\"\n\nObviously, President Donald Trump is encouraging people to go out and vote against Democrats, which everyone should do.\nAt a rally of 8,500 in Indiana on Friday, Trump encouraged them to go out and vote Republican if they didn't want to be uttering the words \"Speaker Pelosi\" over the next two years.\n“If you don’t want to be saying the words ‘Speaker Pelosi’ for the next two years, you gotta go out and vote,” Trump said as he stumped for congressional candidates Greg Pence and Jim Bair.\nTrump also encouraged the crowd to vote for Mike Braun for US Senate.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\n* Yes, military force should be used.\nNo, keep the military out of it.\nEmail *\nPhone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nTrump praised Braun as a man who didn't need the position and is not a career politician.\nJust like his promotion of voting for Republicans in the House would lead to defeating Democrats and keep the words \"Speaker Pelosi\" off our lips, Trump also said that a vote for Braun's opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly, would lead to Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) becoming the Senate Majority leader should the Democrats regain control of the Senate.\nThe president also pointed out that Donnelly had opposed tax cuts and joined with his fellow Democrats in attacking and voting against Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\"The people of Indiana do not have a one-week memory,” said Trump.\n“That was a disgrace what we watched up there.\"\nAdditionally, Trump said that Donnelly voted to provide free health care to illegal aliens and sponsored Senator Dianne Feinstein's (D-CA) \"Open Borders Bill.\"\nWhile some don't believe that Trump's base is all that energized, it seems pretty energetic to me and attacks on conservatives on social media and in search engine results have only furthered their outrage at the establishment, both Democrat and Republican.\nWe're just days away from seeing how things turn out.\nThere's a part of me that thinks this may actually turn out to be one of the biggest turnouts for a mid-term election that we've ever seen, but that's just my gut feeling.\nOn Tuesday, we'll know for sure.\nI don't know about you, but I didn't actually like hearing the words \"Speaker Paul Ryan.\"\nI certainly don't want to hear \"Speaker Pelosi,\" again.\n\n",

New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.\nAmbassador John Bolton.\nFor over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran.\nNow, he’s the National Security Advisor.\nIt just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran.\n“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.\nI had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.\nThe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.\nAnd that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”\nPay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran’s current regime “is centered in this room today.” Who was in that room?\nWell, the entire event was actually put on by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK.\nAs Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism.\nFor decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians.\nTo recap, the formerly terrorist-classified organization MEK, trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012—which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for “regime change” on their behalf—is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3.\nWhile the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane.\nTo see what US intervention—through military support and the support of opposition groups—does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America’s wake.\nTo those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.\nThis was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\n“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said.\n“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”\nAll presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.\nNow it’s Trump’s turn.\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n\n",

            "text_intent": "WATCH: John Bolton Promises Room Full of ‘Former Terrorists’ the US Would ‘Overthrow’ Iran by 2019\n\nFor those who may not be paying attention, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works.\nIn fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009 for this very purpose.\nMEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime.\nThey are hardly quiet about it.\nCoincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies—during this training period—until none other than Hillary Clinton suddenly removed them from the list in 2012.\nAccording to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nIt was widely reported that the MEK was behind the anti-government violence that erupted in Iran in January which snowballed into the situation today.\nHersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.\nAmbassador John Bolton.\nFor over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran.\nNow, he’s the National Security Advisor.\nIt just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran.\n“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.\nI had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran.\nThe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.\nAnd that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”\nPay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran’s current regime “is centered in this room today.” Who was in that room?\nWell, the entire event was actually put on by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK.\nAs Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism.\nFor decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians.\nTo recap, the formerly terrorist-classified organization MEK, trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012—which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for “regime change” on their behalf—is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3.\nWhile the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane.\nTo see what US intervention—through military support and the support of opposition groups—does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America’s wake.\nTo those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.\nThis was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\n“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said.\n“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”\nAll presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.\nNow it’s Trump’s turn.\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge\n\n(CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law.\nA criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop.\nThe bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says.\nThe FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said.\nHaig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said.\nPolice say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others.\nMore than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack.\nInvestigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nDouglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records.\nHaig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings.\nHe is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing.\nThe maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\nHaig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment.\nCNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case.\n\"My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,\" he told KNXV.\nThe complaint\nHaig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest\nIn a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show.\nTracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going.\nHaig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing.\nVictor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock \"was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.\"\nBut in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August.\nIt's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.\nThe complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.\nPhotos: Mass shooting at Las Vegas

            "text_intent": "Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge\n\n(CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law.\nA criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop.\nThe bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says.\nThe FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said.\nHaig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said.\nPolice say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others.\nMore than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack.\nInvestigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nDouglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records.\nHaig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings.\nHe is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing.\nThe maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\nHaig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment.\nCNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case.\n\"My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,\" he told KNXV.\nThe complaint\nHaig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest\nIn a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show.\nTracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going.\nHaig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing.\nVictor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock \"was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.\"\nBut in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August.\nIt's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.\nThe complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.\nPhotos: Mass shooting at Las Vegas

him as a person of interest\nIn a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show.\nTracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going.\nHaig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing.\nVictor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock \"was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.\"\nBut in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August.\nIt's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.\nThe complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.\nPhotos: Mass shooting at Las Vegas

43,000-barrel fuel tank on the grounds of nearby McCarran International Airport in what investigators believe was a failed attempt to cause an explosion.\nHaig did not mention the incendiary rounds -- which are meant to ignite what they hit -- in Friday's news conference.\nVictor, his attorney, declined to comment about CNN's questions about the incendiary rounds.\nThe complaint does not name Haig's associate.\nThe law enforcement sources also said tracer rounds were found in Paddock's hotel room.\nBut there was no evidence the tracer rounds were used during the attack, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about such details.\nAuthorities have repeatedly said Paddock was the only shooter.\nFriday's charges do not allege that Haig knew of Paddock's intentions to kill in Las Vegas.\nHaig says he saw nothing suspicious\nHaig, an aerospace engineer and part-time ammunition reseller, said at Friday's news conference that he never saw anything suspicious in his brief interactions with Paddock.\nPaddock arrived at the seller's home in Mesa \"very well-dressed, very well-groomed, very polite, very respectful,\" Haig said.\n\"At no time did I see anything suspicious or odd or any kind of a tell, anything that would set off an alarm,\" he said.\nHaig also said that he received death threats after his name was revealed this week.\nHe stressed that his sale made \"no contribution\" to the killings since Paddock didn't appear to have fired tracer rounds.\n\"I hope today ends (the death threats) when people realize that I wasn't in collusion with Paddock -- that I was not in any way, shape or form associated with the horrible crime that he committed,\" Haig said.\nTimeline of sales\nHaig said he sold 720 rounds of surplus US military tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after Paddock approached him or an associate at gun shows.\nJUST WATCHED Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out 01:00\nHe held Friday's news conference to protect his reputation, he and his attorney said.\nThey gave the following timeline:\n• Paddock first approached Haig's table at a Las Vegas gun show sometime last year but met another person who was behind the table.\n• Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show, where he was selling ammunition.\n• Paddock took Haig's business card because the seller didn't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted.\n• Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig's home.\n• In September, Paddock arrived at Haig's home, bought the tracer ammunition and drove away.\nThe ammunition, he said, was:\n• 600 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, M62, tracer ammunition, manufactured by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri.\n• 120 rounds of 5.56mm M196 tracer ammunition, manufactured by the same plant.\nHe said the 5.56mm rounds were in their original packaging.\nHe did not comment on the 7.62mm rounds' packaging.\nBefore the sale, Paddock told him \"that he was going to go out to the desert and put on a light show\" with the ammunition -- that he was \"going to go out and shoot it at night with friends.\"\nSeller's reaction to massacre: 'Revulsion'\nVictor said police found his client's name and address on a box that Paddock had -- a box that Haig gave him to carry the tracer rounds he had bought.\nHaig said he learned of the massacre when authorities contacted him at work the next morning.\n\"Revulsion,\" Haig said of his reaction.\n\"Sickness.\nHorror that this man would do something like that.\"\nHaig spoke with investigators four times after the shooting, and has been \"fully cooperative,\" Victor said.\n\"This was a routine transaction to purchase a routine type of ammunition that is available in many different retail outlets throughout the state of Arizona,\" Victor said.\n\"After that transaction, Doug had absolutely no further contact with Mr.\nPaddock.\"\nDeath threats\nHaig said he's received death threats since the search warrant documents were released Tuesday.\n\"One woman (was) screaming through my door that I should be killed and I should die,\" he told reporters at Friday's news conference.\n\"It's been not a lot of fun, quite frankly.\"\nHaig added, \"I had no contribution to what Paddock did.\nI had no way to see into his mind.\"\nHaig named as person of interest\nA Nevada judge on Tuesday unsealed police search warrant records -- prepared shortly after the shooting -- that mentioned two persons of interest in the case.\nThe judge released the documents after CNN and other media outlets sued to obtain them.\nOne person of interest, whom police had named previously, was the killer's girlfriend, Marilou Danley.\nAuthorities subsequently cleared her publicly.\nThe second name was redacted.\nBut the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported it had a version of the search warrant that named, without redaction, Haig as that second person.\nThe documents didn't explain why he was a person of interest.\nLas Vegas police officials told CNN the department couldn't comment on Haig or any names, and referred questions to federal authorities.\nSheriff has said feds were investigating someone\nWhen the search warrant documents were released this week, Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish allowed a small portion of those records to be redacted because \"there is an ongoing investigation regarding charges against another individual, arising out of information obtained in connection with the ... shooting, but not directly related to the shooting.\"\nIn response to a question from CNN in January, the Clark County sheriff, Joe Lombardo, said federal authorities are investigating a person in the case.\nThat person could face federal charges not directly related to the shooting within the next 60 days, the sheriff said January 19.\nLombardo didn't disclose the person's name, saying those details were \"under federal grand jury disclosure\" rules.\nOn Friday morning, before his arrest, Haig answered a reporter's question about whether he believed he was that person.\n\"No.\nI don't think it's me at all,\" Haig said.\n\n",

43,000-barrel fuel tank on the grounds of nearby McCarran International Airport in what investigators believe was a failed attempt to cause an explosion.\nHaig did not mention the incendiary rounds -- which are meant to ignite what they hit -- in Friday's news conference.\nVictor, his attorney, declined to comment about CNN's questions about the incendiary rounds.\nThe complaint does not name Haig's associate.\nThe law enforcement sources also said tracer rounds were found in Paddock's hotel room.\nBut there was no evidence the tracer rounds were used during the attack, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about such details.\nAuthorities have repeatedly said Paddock was the only shooter.\nFriday's charges do not allege that Haig knew of Paddock's intentions to kill in Las Vegas.\nHaig says he saw nothing suspicious\nHaig, an aerospace engineer and part-time ammunition reseller, said at Friday's news conference that he never saw anything suspicious in his brief interactions with Paddock.\nPaddock arrived at the seller's home in Mesa \"very well-dressed, very well-groomed, very polite, very respectful,\" Haig said.\n\"At no time did I see anything suspicious or odd or any kind of a tell, anything that would set off an alarm,\" he said.\nHaig also said that he received death threats after his name was revealed this week.\nHe stressed that his sale made \"no contribution\" to the killings since Paddock didn't appear to have fired tracer rounds.\n\"I hope today ends (the death threats) when people realize that I wasn't in collusion with Paddock -- that I was not in any way, shape or form associated with the horrible crime that he committed,\" Haig said.\nTimeline of sales\nHaig said he sold 720 rounds of surplus US military tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after Paddock approached him or an associate at gun shows.\nJUST WATCHED Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out 01:00\nHe held Friday's news conference to protect his reputation, he and his attorney said.\nThey gave the following timeline:\n• Paddock first approached Haig's table at a Las Vegas gun show sometime last year but met another person who was behind the table.\n• Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show, where he was selling ammunition.\n• Paddock took Haig's business card because the seller didn't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted.\n• Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig's home.\n• In September, Paddock arrived at Haig's home, bought the tracer ammunition and drove away.\nThe ammunition, he said, was:\n• 600 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, M62, tracer ammunition, manufactured by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri.\n• 120 rounds of 5.56mm M196 tracer ammunition, manufactured by the same plant.\nHe said the 5.56mm rounds were in their original packaging.\nHe did not comment on the 7.62mm rounds' packaging.\nBefore the sale, Paddock told him \"that he was going to go out to the desert and put on a light show\" with the ammunition -- that he was \"going to go out and shoot it at night with friends.\"\nSeller's reaction to massacre: 'Revulsion'\nVictor said police found his client's name and address on a box that Paddock had -- a box that Haig gave him to carry the tracer rounds he had bought.\nHaig said he learned of the massacre when authorities contacted him at work the next morning.\n\"Revulsion,\" Haig said of his reaction.\n\"Sickness.\nHorror that this man would do something like that.\"\nHaig spoke with investigators four times after the shooting, and has been \"fully cooperative,\" Victor said.\n\"This was a routine transaction to purchase a routine type of ammunition that is available in many different retail outlets throughout the state of Arizona,\" Victor said.\n\"After that transaction, Doug had absolutely no further contact with Mr.\nPaddock.\"\nDeath threats\nHaig said he's received death threats since the search warrant documents were released Tuesday.\n\"One woman (was) screaming through my door that I should be killed and I should die,\" he told reporters at Friday's news conference.\n\"It's been not a lot of fun, quite frankly.\"\nHaig added, \"I had no contribution to what Paddock did.\nI had no way to see into his mind.\"\nHaig named as person of interest\nA Nevada judge on Tuesday unsealed police search warrant records -- prepared shortly after the shooting -- that mentioned two persons of interest in the case.\nThe judge released the documents after CNN and other media outlets sued to obtain them.\nOne person of interest, whom police had named previously, was the killer's girlfriend, Marilou Danley.\nAuthorities subsequently cleared her publicly.\nThe second name was redacted.\nBut the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported it had a version of the search warrant that named, without redaction, Haig as that second person.\nThe documents didn't explain why he was a person of interest.\nLas Vegas police officials told CNN the department couldn't comment on Haig or any names, and referred questions to federal authorities.\nSheriff has said feds were investigating someone\nWhen the search warrant documents were released this week, Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish allowed a small portion of those records to be redacted because \"there is an ongoing investigation regarding charges against another individual, arising out of information obtained in connection with the ... shooting, but not directly related to the shooting.\"\nIn response to a question from CNN in January, the Clark County sheriff, Joe Lombardo, said federal authorities are investigating a person in the case.\nThat person could face federal charges not directly related to the shooting within the next 60 days, the sheriff said January 19.\nLombardo didn't disclose the person's name, saying those details were \"under federal grand jury disclosure\" rules.\nOn Friday morning, before his arrest, Haig answered a reporter's question about whether he believed he was that person.\n\"No.\nI don't think it's me at all,\" Haig said.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook\n\nFollowing what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced.\nTrump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.\nHe will do a fantastic job!\nThank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!\nGina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.\nCongratulations to all!”\nThis is yet another big shake-up for Trump’s still-young administration — and it may be the most important one to date.\nThe move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state.\nIf you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s.\nLike Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs.\nIn fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too.\nWhile he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting ” itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.”\nAgain, if you liked Obama-era, world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy.\nPompeo also isn’t a huge fan of calling the federal government out when it is clearly violating the rights of Americans, as shown by his statements last year regarding WikiLeaks.\n“It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\nIn January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence — the GRU — had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee.\nAnd the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,” he said.\nPompeo favors increased U.S. involvement in Syria (hello, Russian proxy war), ratcheting pressure on Iran and regime change in North Korea.\nClinton City…\nMoving on to Haspel, who will now be heading the CIA, nothing’s looking any brighter.\nShe’s a big fan of torture, according to a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out this morning by The Intercept:\nIN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake-up” by then-Director John Brennan.\nAs Miller documented, this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush-era torture regime.\nAs Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees.\nEven more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.\nBeyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.\nThe concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.\nA special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.\nBottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren’t going anywhere under Trump.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook\n\nFollowing what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced.\nTrump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.\nHe will do a fantastic job!\nThank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!\nGina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.\nCongratulations to all!”\nThis is yet another big shake-up for Trump’s still-young administration — and it may be the most important one to date.\nThe move creates some big questions about both the administration’s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president’s relationship with the deep state.\nIf you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, you’ll like Pompeo’s.\nLike Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs.\nIn fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too.\nWhile he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting ” itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.”\nAgain, if you liked Obama-era, world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy.\nPompeo also isn’t a huge fan of calling the federal government out when it is clearly violating the rights of Americans, as shown by his statements last year regarding WikiLeaks.\n“It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\nIn January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence — the GRU — had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee.\nAnd the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,” he said.\nPompeo favors increased U.S. involvement in Syria (hello, Russian proxy war), ratcheting pressure on Iran and regime change in North Korea.\nClinton City…\nMoving on to Haspel, who will now be heading the CIA, nothing’s looking any brighter.\nShe’s a big fan of torture, according to a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out this morning by The Intercept:\nIN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake-up” by then-Director John Brennan.\nAs Miller documented, this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush-era torture regime.\nAs Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees.\nEven more troubling, she “had run a secret prison in Thailand” — part of the CIA’s network of “black sites” — “where two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.” The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah.\nBeyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations.\nThe concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane.\nA special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.\nBottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren’t going anywhere under Trump.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama\n\nPresident Trump’s summit Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki created a firestorm of controversy.\nPresident Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies.\nThe initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted: “President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin.\nIt is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected – immediately.”\nAfter flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin, President Trump said he has “full faith and support for America’s great intelligence agencies” and that he accepts “our intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place.”\nIn his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki.\nThe president said: “It should have been obvious – I thought it would be obvious – but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn’t.\nIn a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of “wouldn’t.” The sentence should have been: I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t – or why it wouldn’t be Russia.\nSo just to repeat it, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t’ …\n“I have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections.\nUnlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts – and repel – we will stop it, we will repel it – any efforts to interfere in our elections.\nWe’re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.”\nAnyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake.\nHis natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes.\nFor him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one).\nPresident Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration’s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election.\nPresident Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nPresident Trump said: “President Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now – probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks – they knew about Russia’s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it.\nAnd as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nIt turned out it didn’t happen that way.\n“By contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance – it’s a very firm stance – on a strong action.\nWe’re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.”\nThere are two key facts in this statement.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.\nThe very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.\nIt was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.\nSecond, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.\nThe Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.\nThe Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia.\nAlso, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.\nFurthermore, President Trump’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.\nThe stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.\nBeyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia:\nWhere President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.\nWhen the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.\nWhen the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.\nPresident Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.\nMore than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.\nDespite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia.\nNothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.\nFinally, a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president.\nWe are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing.\nThis is what led me to write my new New York Times best-selling book, “Trump’s America: The Truth About Our Nation’s Great Comeback.” With each passing month the radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more.\nWith President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked.\nIn fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice.\nSimilarly, Obama-era national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack President Trump.\nI think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt.\nWhatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThese former officials attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt.\nJust keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV.\nMy prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia, and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama\n\nPresident Trump’s summit Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki created a firestorm of controversy.\nPresident Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies.\nThe initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted: “President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin.\nIt is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected – immediately.”\nAfter flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin, President Trump said he has “full faith and support for America’s great intelligence agencies” and that he accepts “our intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election took place.”\nIn his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki.\nThe president said: “It should have been obvious – I thought it would be obvious – but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn’t.\nIn a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of “wouldn’t.” The sentence should have been: I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t – or why it wouldn’t be Russia.\nSo just to repeat it, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t’ …\n“I have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections.\nUnlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts – and repel – we will stop it, we will repel it – any efforts to interfere in our elections.\nWe’re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.”\nAnyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake.\nHis natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes.\nFor him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one).\nPresident Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration’s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election.\nPresident Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nPresident Trump said: “President Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now – probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks – they knew about Russia’s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it.\nAnd as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nIt turned out it didn’t happen that way.\n“By contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance – it’s a very firm stance – on a strong action.\nWe’re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.”\nThere are two key facts in this statement.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.\nThe very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.\nIt was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.\nSecond, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.\nThe Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.\nThe Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia.\nAlso, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.\nFurthermore, President Trump’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.\nThe stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.\nBeyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia:\nWhere President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.\nWhen the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.\nWhen the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.\nPresident Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.\nMore than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.\nDespite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia.\nNothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.\nFinally, a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president.\nWe are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing.\nThis is what led me to write my new New York Times best-selling book, “Trump’s America: The Truth About Our Nation’s Great Comeback.” With each passing month the radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more.\nWith President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked.\nIn fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice.\nSimilarly, Obama-era national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack President Trump.\nI think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt.\nWhatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThese former officials attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt.\nJust keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV.\nMy prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia, and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base\n\n“Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base” was the Los Angeles Times headline, and this one is indeed a real mystery.\nA Muslim named Hafiz Kazi, according to the Times, “drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.” After scrutinizing all the evidence closely, the FBI just can’t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi’s motive.\nAnd that in a nutshell shows what’s wrong with today’s FBI.\nSean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office, stated: “We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point.\nNow the question is, why.\nWhy was he there?\nWhat led him there?\nAnd we don’t know answers to that, quite frankly.”\nThe Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed, “they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said.”\nYes, what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery.\nThe Times added that “the dead man’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of ‘jihad’ video was found on Kazi’s phone.”\nAll right.\nNo jihad video.\nAnd no “nexus of terrorism,” according to Sean Ragan.\nWhat is a nexus of terrorism?\nRagan most likely means that investigators didn’t find an ISIS membership card in Kazi’s wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, “I did this for Allah and Islam.\nAllahu akbar.”\nOf course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI’s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive.\nIn any case, a larger point is being lost here.\nAnd that is that there is a war going on.\nWe know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians.\nWe know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself.\nEven if he wasn’t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.\nThe FBI’s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption.\nThe FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism.\nIt doesn’t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others.\nSo each time something like this happens, they’re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive.\nIt’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims.\nAuthorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues.\nHere again, this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room and screaming “Allahu akbar.” Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues among the German High Command.\nThis willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic.\nHow long is this comic opera going to continue?\nIf the jihadis advance even into the FBI’s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis’ motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?\nRobert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch and author of the New York Times bestsellers The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) and The Truth About Muhammad.\nHis new book is Confessions of an Islamophobe.\nFollow him on Twitter here.\nLike him on Facebook here.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Former Navy Sailor Pardoned By Trump To Sue Obama & Comey\n\nKristian Saucier, a former Navy sailor who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine he worked on but was later pardoned by President Donald Trump, says that he is going to pursue a lawsuit against several Obama administration members, including Former FBI Director James Comes and Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah.\nThe same FBI that gave Hillary Clinton a pass for operating an illegal email server, which we have evidence for the fact that she sent and received classified documents through resulting in a national security breach and at least one death, but would not give the same leniency to Saucier who simply took some pictures of his submarine.\nFox News reports:\ntake our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\n* Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker\nEmail *\nEmail This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nHis lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.\n“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.\nHillary is still walking free.\nTwo guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.\nWe want them to correct the wrong.” Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.\nThere is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.\n“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said.\n“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”\nSaucier's attorneys attempted to use the Hillary Clinton defense to get him out of hot water for taking pictures of classified systems aboard the USS Alexandria in 2009.\nProsecutors sloughed off the defense, saying it was essentially “grasping at highly imaginative and speculative straws in trying to further draw a comparison to the matter of Secretary Hillary Clinton based upon virtually no understanding and knowledge of the facts involved, the information at issue, not to mention any issues if intent and knowledge.”\nSaucier confessed to taking photos of the submarine back in 2009 when he served as a 22-year-old machinist mate, saying he wanted to show the pictures to his family and future children.\nFollowing an interview with the FBI in 2012, he destroyed all evidence of the pictures, meaning the Naval Criminal Investigative Service could not confirm his claims that he did not share the photos with unauthorized people.\n“It was a foolish mistake by a very young man,” Saucier’s lawyer, Greg Rinckey, said.\n“It’s a very sad case because Kristian Saucier is a fine young man.\nWe don’t believe this was really his true character.”\n“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” Saucier said.\n“They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,” he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons.\nPresident Trump had spoken of his support of Saucier on the campaign trail and blasted the Obama administration's handling of his case.\n“With a pardon, there’s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,” Saucier said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.”\nThat's a good attitude considering he has had his cars repossessed and is in a tremendous amount of debt due to his incarceration and now having a felony on his record.\nBut hey, Hillary is free, right?\nThat's all that matters, cause after all, they're (Bill and Hillary) good people, aren't they, Mr. President?\nI think it's great that Mr. Saucier has been pardoned, I really do, but I continue to ask what a lot of Americans continue to ask, why does the known criminal Hillary Clinton remain at large in our country with her corrupt foundation taking in billions, her trashing our Republic and continuing to have a national voice?\nThe American people weren't promised pardons, we were promised a special counsel to dig into the Clintons and bring about justice.\nIt's time that occurred.\n\n",

Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood.\nIn the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky.\nHe also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row.\nCourt documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.\nSimply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law.\nPatel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017.\nCourt documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012.\nBefore Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges.\nDuring the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims.\nPatel agreed to bring it by, but two days later he told the State Department he had accidentally thrown it away in October and needed a new one.\nAfter Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport \"near\" the motel room where he was living, the documents said.\n©2018 The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.)\nVisit The Virginian-Pilot at pilotonline.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "MSM Using Kavanaugh Sex Scandal to Distract You From Real Reason He Shouldn’t Be Confirmed\n\nIn July, President Donald Trump nominated D.C.\nCircuit Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\nSince then, there have been numerous allegations of sexual misconduct levied toward the Justice to be.\nWhether or not he is guilty of these allegations is left to be determined.\nHowever, it does serve as a great distraction from his actual constitution-hating and tyrannical tendencies.\nWhile Kavanaugh may be an ostensible supporter of the Second Amendment, his record indicates that he all but cannot stand the Fourth and he’s not that big a fan of the First either.\nWhile the allegations against Kavanaugh should certainly be investigated — no matter how they are being spun by the left and the right — he shouldn’t even be in this position based solely on his previous record.\nBut no one is talking about this.\nInstead, the left and right are involved in a mudslinging orgy of victim shaming and kangaroo courts.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?\n* John Bolton Richard Grenell Dina Powell Heather Nauert Ivanka Trump\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nAccording to this Supreme Court nominee, he thinks it is just fine and dandy for police and government to track you, spy on you, and dig through your personal life — without a warrant.\nOn multiple occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state’s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens.\nAs Reason points out, in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit’s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer’s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant.\nKavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person’s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn’t constitute a “search” as defined by the Fourth Amendment.\nTo Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is “constitutional.” In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone’s physical property, or track someone’s cell phone.\nLuckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this.\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant.\nBut it gets worse.\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA’s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is “entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.” To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens’ phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure.\nSeriously.\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches “without individualized suspicion” when the government demonstrates a “special need” that “outweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.”\nExactly what this “special need” is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again.\n“The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,” Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh’s views on the disposable nature of the constitution.\nKavanaugh “has no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a “counterterrorism exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement,” said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program.\nWhile the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims, others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state and an enemy to privacy.\nRepresentative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed.\nHowever, this hasn’t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court.\n“Privacy advocates must fight,” Amash tweeted.\n“There are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations.\nThe only question is will the Senate confirm one who is really bad on the #4thAmendment, when so much is at stake in upcoming digital privacy battles.”\nIndeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us.\nThe cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep.\nAs for if Kavanaugh gets appointed, Amash has some harsh words to those who are blindly supporting him based on party lines:\n“When Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, undermining our #4thAmendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, it will be too late for others to join me.”\nBelow is a video taken at the Mises Institute of Judge Napolitano explaining the implications of this enemy of the Fourth Amendment on the Supreme Court.\nJudge Andrew #Napolitano on Brett #Kavanaugh and the #PatriotAct At Mises University, Judge Andrew Napolitano breaks down some of the troubling parts of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's legal career.\nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/15-5307/15-5307-2015-11-20.htmlLong story short, #Kavanaugh is not a friend to civil liberties or the Constitution.\nHe helped to uphold the UnConstitutional Patriot Act which of course paved the way for the Indefinte Detention provisions of the NDAA.\nAuburn, Alabama; 16 July 2018.\nLink to entire video: https://youtu.be/1uTR3qNW70w#StoptheNDAA Posted by People Against the NDAA on Tuesday, September 25, 2018\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n\n",

Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said he’s seen credible evidence that ISIS was involved in the devastating Las Vegas shooting.\nISIS terrorists, he said, infiltrated the U.S. via the southern border prior to the attack blamed on alleged lone gunman Stephen Paddock.\n“Recently I have been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence, credible information regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident,” Perry said.\nPerry added that ISIS warnings of a forthcoming attack on Las Vegas prior to the shooting make a terror link even more likely.\n“Well, they could be–lets face it, ISIS twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States that they would attack Las Vegas in June and August after the attack claimed responsibility four times.\nMeanwhile, the local law enforcement investigative services are telling us there is no terrorist connection–lone gunman, again, something is not adding up,” Perry replied.\nAn incredulous Carlson asked fellow guest Catherine Lombardo, a lawyer representing families affected by the tragedy, about the law enforcement investigation into the shooting.\n“The FBI and the Las Vegas metro police department have been conducting the investigation, ” she said.\n“We’ve seen no evidence of a terrorist attack, and I will ask with all due respect, congressman, unless have you specific evidence to back that up, it seems a bit irresponsible to make that allegation so, if you do, or make that assertion, if do you have any evidence of that, I’m asking you right now to share it with us and tell us what that is.\nMy clients… victims, all 22,000 people have been waiting and waiting and waiting for evidence.”\nPerry noted that all Americans are still lacking all the evidence.\n“We’ve all been waiting, and I’m waiting, too.\nLike I said, nothing adds up, but I’m just telling you, I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus, and we’re gonna have to wait… until the situation develops,” he said.\nThe lawmaker said he wants the nation’s counterterror agencies involved in the investigation.\n“If ISIS warns about an attack and then an attack occurs and claims responsibility after the fact, it seems to me that at a minimum, they should have some portion of the investigation to clearly debunk that claim and, yet, it hasn’t happened,” he said.\n\n",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017\nI’m not sure we’re doing just fine, but Trump is right that the real problem is jihad terror and Sharia supremacism, and British authorities want to ignore that and shoot the messenger.\nAnd so Chris Bryant, “a senior Labour backbencher, has written to May urging her to go further, and issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is ‘not conducive to the public good’, a senior Labour MP has said.”\nFor Chris Bryant, apparently “fascism” means “defense of Britain and its values against jihad terror.”\nBryant “cited the cases of two US far-right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller , who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump.”\nWhy are we “far right”?\nEverything we do is in defense of the freedom of speech and equality of rights of all people before the law.\nThat’s “far right”?\nIn any case, note well: the letter to me from the UK Home Office said that I was banned for saying that “[Islam] is a religion and is a belief system that mandates warfare against unbelievers…”\nThat’s a demonstrably true statement.\nMeanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation.\nSyed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain.\nThe UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: “If there’s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things.\nOne – the easiest one maybe – chop their head off, that’s the easiest.\nSecond – burn them to death.\nThird – throw ’em off a cliff.\nFourth – tear down a wall on them so they die under that.\nFifth – a combination of the above.”\nMay’s government admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.\nOne of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nMeanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country.\nChris Bryant had nothing to say about any of those jihad preachers entering Britain with no problem.\n“UK ambassador conveys concerns over Trump retweet to White House,” by Rowena Mason, Guardian, November 30, 2017:\n…Chris Bryant, a senior Labour backbencher, has written to May urging her to go further, and issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is “not conducive to the public good”, a senior Labour MP has said.\nBryant, a former Foreign Office minister, said the prime minister should issue a prohibition order against the president like those that apply to other far right figures from the US.\nHe cited the cases of two US far right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump.\nIn a letter to May, he said: “I am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country.\n“In retweeting Jayda Fransen’s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity.\nThis activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets.\nMs Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal.\nMany of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this.”…\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Avenatti’s Freak Show\n\nOn the eve of a historic Supreme Court confirmation hearing, two more women have materialized out of thin air to accuse President Trump’s high court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual improprieties – bringing the total number of accusers to four.\nEven more eleventh-hour character-assassination attempts may be coming given the enraged Left’s determination to prevent the judge’s ascent to the Supreme Court at all costs.\nWhether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people.\nOnly the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle.\nThey don’t care about the victims they create.\nOnly the headlines.\nThe new allegations surfaced yesterday as the Senate Judiciary Committee battens down the hatches for a hearing today to receive oral evidence from the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student.\nThe third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped.\nIncredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway.\nIt gets weirder.\nKavanaugh was a “mean drunk,” she stated.\nHe drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said.\nSwetnick claimed to have been gang-raped at one of these parties in 1982 as a result of consuming a spiked drink that contained “Quaaludes or something similar.” Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at the party at which she was raped, she states, but she doesn’t accuse them of participating in it.\nIn response, Kavanaugh labeled Swetnick's salacious allegations \"ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.\"\n\"I don't know who this is and this never happened,\" the judicial nominee added.\nA CNBC summary describes Swetnick:\nA 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies.\nSwetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s \"drink excessively at many\" house parties in suburban Maryland.\nAt the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school.\nShe said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in \"abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,\" which \"included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent\" and \"not taking 'No' for an answer.\"\nPredictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either \"immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations.\"\nThere is no indication so far that the president will oblige them.\nTo no one’s surprise, Trump’s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed “creepy porn lawyer,” is representing Swetnick.\n\"There should be an immediate investigation\" of Swetnick’s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, \"and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\nThe president slammed Avenatti.\n“Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh[,]” Trump wrote on Twitter.\n“He is just looking for attention and doesn’t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!”\nHe rejected Swetnick’s allegations as “another beauty” and described Avenatti as a “con artist.”\n“All of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,” Trump said.\n“And then you this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.\"\nA fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports.\nAccording to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:\nAn anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner’s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states.\nKavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.\nDepending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.\nThe newspaper account continues:\nThe transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators.\nAnd GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).\nAccuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday.\nRamirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.\nShe claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nIf Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nIt normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nThe proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.\nCommittee Republicans considered the political optics and didn’t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing.\nDemocrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.\n“It is going against everything I’ve seen for 44 years,\" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).\n\"They’re not following normal procedure.\"\nAs expected, at today’s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.\nAccording to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:\nI categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.\nI never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.\nI am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.\nBut I have never done that to her or to anyone.\nKavanaugh added: \"I am innocent of this charge.\"\nNot surprisingly Ford’s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.\n“I am here today not because I want to be,” Ford says in her opening statement.\n“I am terrified.\nI am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”\nShe describes the nominee as “Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,” and claims “Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life,” but at the same time acknowledges “Brett did not rape me.”\nGiven that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.\nMany commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties.\nBoth women are college professors.\nBoth claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.\nFord claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.\nOnly left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill, now an utterly undistinguished politically correct scholar who discredited herself by –among other things— following her then-boss Thomas as his subordinate when he switched jobs.\nAn abused person wouldn’t do that.\nBut all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” had an effect.\nIn the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991.\nWith all the mud Democrats have been slinging at Kavanaugh, he would be thrilled to be approved by a margin as wide as 52 to 48.\nConservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left’s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him.\nIf they can derail Kavanaugh’s nomination, that is an added bonus.\nThe Left’s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:\nDisapproval for Kavanaugh … is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll.\nThose surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.\nThe case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee.\nThat said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.\n\"If we're ready to vote, we will vote,” Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. “If we aren't ready, we won't.”\nObviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation.\n“We're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday.\n\"And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court.\"\nPresident Trump quoted the nation’s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:\n“Rush Limbaugh to Republicans: ‘You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don’t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.’”\nTrump is right.\n\n",

            "text_intent": "Avenatti’s Freak Show\n\nOn the eve of a historic Supreme Court confirmation hearing, two more women have materialized out of thin air to accuse President Trump’s high court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual improprieties – bringing the total number of accusers to four.\nEven more eleventh-hour character-assassination attempts may be coming given the enraged Left’s determination to prevent the judge’s ascent to the Supreme Court at all costs.\nWhether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people.\nOnly the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle.\nThey don’t care about the victims they create.\nOnly the headlines.\nThe new allegations surfaced yesterday as the Senate Judiciary Committee battens down the hatches for a hearing today to receive oral evidence from the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student.\nThe third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped.\nIncredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway.\nIt gets weirder.\nKavanaugh was a “mean drunk,” she stated.\nHe drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said.\nSwetnick claimed to have been gang-raped at one of these parties in 1982 as a result of consuming a spiked drink that contained “Quaaludes or something similar.” Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at the party at which she was raped, she states, but she doesn’t accuse them of participating in it.\nIn response, Kavanaugh labeled Swetnick's salacious allegations \"ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.\"\n\"I don't know who this is and this never happened,\" the judicial nominee added.\nA CNBC summary describes Swetnick:\nA 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies.\nSwetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s \"drink excessively at many\" house parties in suburban Maryland.\nAt the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school.\nShe said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in \"abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,\" which \"included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent\" and \"not taking 'No' for an answer.\"\nPredictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either \"immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations.\"\nThere is no indication so far that the president will oblige them.\nTo no one’s surprise, Trump’s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed “creepy porn lawyer,” is representing Swetnick.\n\"There should be an immediate investigation\" of Swetnick’s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, \"and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\nThe president slammed Avenatti.\n“Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh[,]” Trump wrote on Twitter.\n“He is just looking for attention and doesn’t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!”\nHe rejected Swetnick’s allegations as “another beauty” and described Avenatti as a “con artist.”\n“All of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,” Trump said.\n“And then you this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.\"\nA fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports.\nAccording to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:\nAn anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner’s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states.\nKavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.\nDepending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.\nThe newspaper account continues:\nThe transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators.\nAnd GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).\nAccuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday.\nRamirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.\nShe claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nIf Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nIt normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nThe proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.\nCommittee Republicans considered the political optics and didn’t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing.\nDemocrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.\n“It is going against everything I’ve seen for 44 years,\" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).\n\"They’re not following normal procedure.\"\nAs expected, at today’s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.\nAccording to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:\nI categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.\nI never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.\nI am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.\nBut I have never done that to her or to anyone.\nKavanaugh added: \"I am innocent of this charge.\"\nNot surprisingly Ford’s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.\n“I am here today not because I want to be,” Ford says in her opening statement.\n“I am terrified.\nI am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”\nShe describes the nominee as “Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,” and claims “Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life,” but at the same time acknowledges “Brett did not rape me.”\nGiven that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.\nMany commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties.\nBoth women are college professors.\nBoth claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.\nFord claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.\nOnly left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill, now an utterly undistinguished politically correct scholar who discredited herself by –among other things— following her then-boss Thomas as his subordinate when he switched jobs.\nAn abused person wouldn’t do that.\nBut all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” had an effect.\nIn the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991.\nWith all the mud Democrats have been slinging at Kavanaugh, he would be thrilled to be approved by a margin as wide as 52 to 48.\nConservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left’s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him.\nIf they can derail Kavanaugh’s nomination, that is an added bonus.\nThe Left’s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:\nDisapproval for Kavanaugh … is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll.\nThose surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.\nThe case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee.\nThat said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.\n\"If we're ready to vote, we will vote,” Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. “If we aren't ready, we won't.”\nObviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation.\n“We're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday.\n\"And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court.\"\nPresident Trump quoted the nation’s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:\n“Rush Limbaugh to Republicans: ‘You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don’t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.’”\nTrump is right.\n\n",

Cory Gardner’s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states.\nKavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.\nDepending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.\nThe newspaper account continues:\nThe transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators.\nAnd GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).\nAccuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday.\nRamirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.\nShe claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nIf Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nIt normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nThe proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.\nCommittee Republicans considered the political optics and didn’t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing.\nDemocrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.\n“It is going against everything I’ve seen for 44 years,\" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).\n\"They’re not following normal procedure.\"\nAs expected, at today’s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.\nAccording to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:\nI categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.\nI never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.\nI am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.\nBut I have never done that to her or to anyone.\nKavanaugh added: \"I am innocent of this charge.\"\nNot surprisingly Ford’s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.\n“I am here today not because I want to be,” Ford says in her opening statement.\n“I am terrified.\nI am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”\nShe describes the nominee as “Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,” and claims “Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life,” but at the same time acknowledges “Brett did not rape me.”\nGiven that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.\nMany commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties.\nBoth women are college professors.\nBoth claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.\nFord claims to be a victim of attempted rape;

Bush administration.\nAs for her ties with Goldman Sachs, Breitbart reported the following:\n1 – When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women’s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman’s foundation.\n2 – Powell’s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects.\n3 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation.\n4 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton’s State Department in a project announced by Clinton.\n5 – Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chief, John Podesta.\n6 – There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell’s 10,000 Women and the Clintons.\n7 – Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton.\n8 – In coming to Goldman Sachs, Powell joined a firm that has long been deeply tied to the Clintons.\nDaniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell:\n“The media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin.\nShe’s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations.\nShe’s friends with Valerie Jarrett….Habib Powell had all the right friends.\nLike Valerie Jarrett.\nArianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in.\nHer ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin.\nYou could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess.\nYou can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.\nThe ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.\nKhalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal.\nAnd Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO’s Hanan Ashrawi….Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.\nHer top role at the NSC represents McMaster’s vision for our approach to Islam.\nAnd it’s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years.\nFlynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump’s vision.\nMcMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush’s vision.”\nGreenfield also adds:\nWhen visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, “visited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.” “I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,” she gushed.\nK.T.\nMcFarland had written that “Global Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.” It’s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell.\nHabib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups.\nYou can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.\nThe ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.\nShe was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi.\nHer achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel.\nWhile President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN, “Over 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.”\nPamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador.\nDina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.\nShe is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump’s agenda.\nBack in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared.\nMcMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers.\nMcMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were “irreligious.” McMaster forced out superb K.T.\nMcFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib-Powell, former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett.\nAgain, and I have asked this before, how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions?\nHow do you drain the swamp by adding to it?\nThe answer is clear: You don't.\nThis would actually be the perfect time for Trump not to appoint an ambassador to the UN and call for the US to exit the anti-American organization and demand Congress stop funding it and evict the UN from US soil, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\n",

Bush administration.\nAs for her ties with Goldman Sachs, Breitbart reported the following:\n1 – When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women’s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman’s foundation.\n2 – Powell’s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects.\n3 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation.\n4 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton’s State Department in a project announced by Clinton.\n5 – Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chief, John Podesta.\n6 – There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell’s 10,000 Women and the Clintons.\n7 – Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton.\n8 – In coming to Goldman Sachs, Powell joined a firm that has long been deeply tied to the Clintons.\nDaniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell:\n“The media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin.\nShe’s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations.\nShe’s friends with Valerie Jarrett….Habib Powell had all the right friends.\nLike Valerie Jarrett.\nArianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in.\nHer ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin.\nYou could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess.\nYou can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.\nThe ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.\nKhalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal.\nAnd Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO’s Hanan Ashrawi….Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.\nHer top role at the NSC represents McMaster’s vision for our approach to Islam.\nAnd it’s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years.\nFlynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump’s vision.\nMcMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush’s vision.”\nGreenfield also adds:\nWhen visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, “visited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.” “I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,” she gushed.\nK.T.\nMcFarland had written that “Global Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.” It’s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell.\nHabib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups.\nYou can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.\nThe ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.\nShe was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi.\nHer achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel.\nWhile President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN, “Over 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.”\nPamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador.\nDina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.\nShe is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump’s agenda.\nBack in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared.\nMcMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers.\nMcMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were “irreligious.” McMaster forced out superb K.T.\nMcFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib-Powell, former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett.\nAgain, and I have asked this before, how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions?\nHow do you drain the swamp by adding to it?\nThe answer is clear: You don't.\nThis would actually be the perfect time for Trump not to appoint an ambassador to the UN and call for the US to exit the anti-American organization and demand Congress stop funding it and evict the UN from US soil, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\n",

Bush administration.\nAs for her ties with Goldman Sachs, Breitbart reported the following:\n1 – When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women’s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman’s foundation.\n2 – Powell’s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects.\n3 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation.\n4 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton’s State Department in a project announced by Clinton.\n5 – Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chief, John Podesta.\n6 – There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell’s 10,000 Women and the Clintons.\n7 – Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton.\n8 – In coming to Goldman Sachs, Powell joined a firm that has long been deeply tied to the Clintons.\nDaniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell:\n“The media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin.\nShe’s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations.\nShe’s friends with Valerie Jarrett….Habib Powell had all the right friends.\nLike Valerie Jarrett.\nArianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in.\nHer ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin.\nYou could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess.\nYou can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.\nThe ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.\nKhalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal.\nAnd Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO’s Hanan Ashrawi….Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.\nHer top role at the NSC represents McMaster’s vision for our approach to Islam.\nAnd it’s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years.\nFlynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump’s vision.\nMcMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush’s vision.”\nGreenfield also adds:\nWhen visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, “visited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.” “I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,” she gushed.\nK.T.\nMcFarland had written that “Global Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.” It’s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell.\nHabib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups.\nYou can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.\nThe ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.\nShe was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi.\nHer achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel.\nWhile President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN, “Over 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.”\nPamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador.\nDina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.\nShe is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump’s agenda.\nBack in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared.\nMcMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers.\nMcMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were “irreligious.” McMaster forced out superb K.T.\nMcFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib-Powell, former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett.\nAgain, and I have asked this before, how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions?\nHow do you drain the swamp by adding to it?\nThe answer is clear: You don't.\nThis would actually be the perfect time for Trump not to appoint an ambassador to the UN and call for the US to exit the anti-American organization and demand Congress stop funding it and evict the UN from US soil, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\n",

Kavanaugh.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\n* Yes, military force should be used.\nNo, keep the military out of it.\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe Washington Times reports:\nA watchdog group filed a Senate ethics complaint Monday against Sens.\nKamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren for sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh — even before they cast their votes against him.\nWhile voting and then asking supporters to back that decision with cash is common, the watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), says asking for money ahead of time crosses the line into vote-buying.\nFACT asked the Senate ethics committee to probe fundraising emails sent by Ms. Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and Ms. Harris, California Democrat.\nMs. Warren’s email said she was demanding a delay on the judge’s confirmation vote and asked for donations for her 2018 election campaign, while Ms. Harris’s emails detailed several of her actions as a member of the Judiciary Committee, including her questioning of the president’s pick for the high court, and asking for contributions.\nThe Senate's own rules prohibit this kind of behavior, but will the Senate hold these women to the standard they've set?\n“This is a clear violation of the Senate Ethics rules which safeguard against the appearance or actuality of elected officials ‘cashing in’ on their official position for political purposes,” said Kendra Arnold, executive director of FACT.\nOf course, but like most of these kinds of violations, the only thing that might actually occur here is censure, and that is highly unlikely in the current climate.\nHowever, voters should be aware of the unethical practice of both of these senators.\nWhile Harris is not up for re-election this year, Warren is.\nCould the good people of Massachusetts do us all a favor and elect someone else in her place?\n\n",

Kavanaugh.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\nShould military force be used to stop the caravan of migrants marching toward the U.S. border?\n* Yes, military force should be used.\nNo, keep the military out of it.\nEmail *\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nCompleting this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe Washington Times reports:\nA watchdog group filed a Senate ethics complaint Monday against Sens.\nKamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren for sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh — even before they cast their votes against him.\nWhile voting and then asking supporters to back that decision with cash is common, the watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), says asking for money ahead of time crosses the line into vote-buying.\nFACT asked the Senate ethics committee to probe fundraising emails sent by Ms. Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and Ms. Harris, California Democrat.\nMs. Warren’s email said she was demanding a delay on the judge’s confirmation vote and asked for donations for her 2018 election campaign, while Ms. Harris’s emails detailed several of her actions as a member of the Judiciary Committee, including her questioning of the president’s pick for the high court, and asking for contributions.\nThe Senate's own rules prohibit this kind of behavior, but will the Senate hold these women to the standard they've set?\n“This is a clear violation of the Senate Ethics rules which safeguard against the appearance or actuality of elected officials ‘cashing in’ on their official position for political purposes,” said Kendra Arnold, executive director of FACT.\nOf course, but like most of these kinds of violations, the only thing that might actually occur here is censure, and that is highly unlikely in the current climate.\nHowever, voters should be aware of the unethical practice of both of these senators.\nWhile Harris is not up for re-election this year, Warren is.\nCould the good people of Massachusetts do us all a favor and elect someone else in her place?\n\n",
