We don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course, but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans. And now this, finally, a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud. Bishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a \u201chater\u201d for defending the Church\u2019s teaching on marriage\u2014an attack, by the way, which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year. \"If you'll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred! As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity. As the Book of Proverbs says 'My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov. 8:7).' It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin. \u2013 Bishop Robert Morlino This is what a courageous shepherd looks like! In our opinion, during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history, every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done, i.e., issue a statement of fidelity to the Church\u2019s moral theology, specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts. In so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes. They will be crucified in the media, yes. But they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church\u2019s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within. Nothing less will do. Bishop Morlino has now done it, and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds, accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news. May God bless and keep Bishop Robert Morlino. MJM Bishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church August 18, 2018 Dear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison, The past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals. Still more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light. For my part \u2014 and I know I am not alone \u2014 I am tired of this. I am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt! I am tired of the obfuscation of truth. I am tired of sin. And, as one who has tried \u2014 despite my many imperfections \u2014 to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people. The stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening. Hearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick. But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years. For them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities. To them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart. If you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal. Also, if you\u2019ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim\u2019s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible. There is nothing about these stories that is okay. These actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church. Faced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair. And why? The reality of sin \u2014 even sin in the Church \u2014 is nothing new. We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity. So what is new? What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others. Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the \u201cwages of sin.\u201d For too long we have diminished the reality of sin \u2014 we have refused to call a sin a sin \u2014 and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy. In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation. Why do we do this? Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being \u201cpastoral?\u201d Have we covered over the truth out of fear? Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world? Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives? Perhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this. In the end, the excuses do not matter. We must be done with sin. It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable. Love sinners? Yes. Accept true repentance? Yes. But do not say sin is okay. And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences. For the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come. The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church. There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living. If you\u2019ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred! As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity. As the Book of Proverbs says \u201cMy mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov. 8:7).\u201d It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin. There must be no room left, no refuge for sin \u2014 either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities. To be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled. In this I speak of all sin. But to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual \u2014 almost exclusively homosexual \u2014 acts by clerics. We\u2019re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals. We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all. To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further. There has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia. That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia \u2014 this despite clear evidence to the contrary. It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more. To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable \u2014 neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one\u2019s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority. In this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick\u2019s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power. The well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence. While recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification. It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord. The Church\u2019s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest. And the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable. Such wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred. Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness. But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy. At the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense. In fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come. Motivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty. The sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians. The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ\u2019s name. It causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds \u2014 which is the very definition of scandal. And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake. I said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this. However, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God. No matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God\u2019s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence. I have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective. Here now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese: In the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese. This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve. We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals. Here again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement. If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim\u2019s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources. If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don\u2019t want to, please still reach out to us. To our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector. I will address it swiftly and vigorously. I will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation. I trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation. To our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day. You are called to serve Christ\u2019s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours. This is to keep you very close to God. In addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop. In obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest \u2014 as Christ Himself is calling you to do. And by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve. God will give you the graces to do so. Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day. And if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me. I will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries. To the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward. It will be addressed quickly and justly. If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well. Such actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person. Again, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church. Furthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice; I will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed; I will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood. Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship; I will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ; I ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well. I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse; I ask everyone reading this to pray. Pray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers. Pray for our seminarians. And pray for yourselves and your families. We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and Finally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy. I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes. In addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same. Some sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting. This letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally. More than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil. We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness. We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors \u2014 myself included \u2014 that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness. We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth. Again, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and \u201chouse cleaning\u201d of this type of depravity. I stand with them. I don\u2019t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally. But I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: \u201cAs for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.\u201d Faithfully yours in the Lord, Most Rev. Robert C. Morlino Bishop of Madison This text first appeared in the Madison Catholic Herald.  ",

        "content": "Et Tu, Benedict? (Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)  Recently an editor of a \u201cconservative\u201d Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on. I declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies. It\u2019s been five years, and I\u2019ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a \u201ccourageous\u201d act it was to give up the pontificate. The consequences of that act have been so outlandish \u2013 even for people who are mostly OK with Francis \u2013 that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it. Editor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr. Dario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation. In no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that \u201cthere is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.\u201d Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica. Our thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below. MJM In fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope \u2013 a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the \u201cfilth\u201d in the Curia and throughout the church \u2013 suddenly just decide to quit? Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed? At the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty. These absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did. We cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before. Could we have been wrong about him? And if so, could we have been this wrong? For reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d There was some implication that he didn\u2019t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn\u2019t make it to World Youth Day and similar events. The trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself. Of all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously. And since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him? This man whom we had believed a \u201cchampion of orthodoxy,\u201d whom we thought we knew. Error, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is. How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life. After three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: \u201cYour goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.\u201d Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn\u2019t lie: So strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind. But this is not what we see. There he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud. \u201cPerhaps it was written for him.\u201d Well, why repeat it then? Why, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda? If it is a deception, why participate in it? In fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they \u201cmiss\u201d him have failed to respect him in one way; they won\u2019t take him at his word. Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn\u2019t valid. But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely. And indeed, far from being an isolated \u201cprisoner of the Vatican,\u201d Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism. We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat. There\u2019s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn\u2019t add up, it\u2019s true. All the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses: Why did you resign? Ratzinger: \u201cI was a bit tired and didn\u2019t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.\u201d If you\u2019re not pope, why do you still wear the white? Ratzinger: \u201cOh, there wasn\u2019t a black cassock that fit me.\u201d Why do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope? Ratzinger: \u201cWell, I\u2019m an \u2018emeritus,\u2019 you see\u2026\u201d And where did this \u201cemeritus\u201d business come from? Does it have any precedent in Catholic history? What does it mean canonically and doctrinally? Ratzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d What was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided \u201cmunus\u201d \u2013 with an active member and a \u201ccontemplative member\u201d? Doesn\u2019t that just mean there are two popes now? Ratzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d And perhaps most agonising of all: \u201cHow can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?\u201d A few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict. Steve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud: Five years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy. And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time \u2013 one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture. You may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has. He walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment. And still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he\u2019s the only one who won\u2019t be canonized. Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger? I have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s really just that he wasn\u2019t who we thought he was.\u201d I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine. I think we made the mistake of believing the press. We were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him. We failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism. What the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a \u201cprogressive,\u201d as the term was understood in 1962. This reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council\u2019s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne. Frings\u2019 claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF \u2013 and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani \u2013 for the \u201cconservatism\u201d in the \u201cschema,\u201d the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops\u2019 discussions. After this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema \u2013 that had taken years to develop \u2013 be abandoned. This was done, over Ottaviani\u2019s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French \u201cprogressives\u201d who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started. It has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger \u2013 the maverick \u201cprogressive\u201d academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary \u2013 who wrote that speech. Cardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said: \u201cJoseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card. Frings, Archbishop of Cologne. Blind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions. Now then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office. Despite a reply by Card. Ottaviani, Frings sustained his critique.  \u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.  \u201cCard. Seper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation. Ratzinger, who did not change, continues it.\u201d Ratzinger\u2019s reputation as a \u201cprogressive\u201d is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work. It went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church \u201cnever to return\u201d to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX. In his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, \u201cShould the Council be revoked?\u201d and in response recommended the \u201crazing of the bastions\u201d of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world: The duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.  This implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word. Neither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian. Hence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty. It was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength. But to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord. His was the thesis \u2013 a mainstay of \u201cconservative\u201d ideology \u2013 that the \u201creal\u201d Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left. How ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had \u201cdestroyed\u201d and would gain the media-generated reputation as an \u201carch-conservative\u201d. And it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure. With the \u201carch-conservative\u201d \u201cRottweiler\u201d Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today? What did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism \u2013 that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II? What did \u201csilencing\u201d by Ratzinger\u2019s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity \u201cpriest-theologian,\u201d courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism? Kung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy? Can we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree? Precious few. But we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith \u2013 academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world \u2013 with never a peep of protest from Rome. Moreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the \u201carch-conservative\u201d John Paul II and the \u201cRottweiler\u201d Benedict XVI pontificates. Why did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy? Is it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement? The \u201cprogressive\u201d destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet \u201carch-conservative\u201d\u2026 Indeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions. He was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological \u201cleft\u201d after the 1960s while he stayed in place. Perhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this. Perhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called \u201cprogressive\u201d in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a \u201cchampion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy\u201d by 2005. Is this why he resigned? Is it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it? Perhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the \u201cliberal\u201d European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the \u201cSankt Gallen Mafia\u201d that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict. Fausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops\u2019 palace of Milan in June 2012. Martini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy. Apparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia. By 2012, this had proved impossible. Why would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini \u2013 the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the \u201cliberal wing\u201d of European Catholicism? I think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger. They were esteemed academic colleagues. They were brothers of the episcopate. They were members of the club. Any appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative. Why wouldn\u2019t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal? Why is Walter Kasper a cardinal? One of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these \u201cconservative\u201d prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals. It beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia. When, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope. Jorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the \u201cultra-liberal\u201d \u201cwing\u201d of the post-Vatican II Church. In an article on the cardinal\u2019s life\u2019s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict. The monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper\u2019s work as Bergoglio\u2019s. This is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome. Jansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another \u201cSankt Gallen\u201d member. This was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF. But that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn\u2019t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear? Why was he not \u2013 at the very least \u2013 given the same \u201csilencing\u201d treatment as Kung? Kasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic. But it\u2019s a simple truth: he\u2019s a heretic. Everyone knows he\u2019s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades. After openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal. Remember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger\u2019s CDF in 1993. But he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way. Nor was he removed from places of influence. Far from it. In 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue. In 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the \u201cecumenical\u201d office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign. In 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave. Then Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal. And, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger\u2019s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave. As Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five, Cardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age. But since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election. (As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.) Excuse me Maike, but I don\u2019t think this is a parenthetical issue. Is it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected? Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope \u201cEmeritus\u201d Benedict \u2013 whatever you want to call yourself \u2013 I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal? Why is he still a bishop? Why is he still allowed to call himself a \u201cCatholic theologian\u201d? Why did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be? Doesn\u2019t anyone else want to know this? Don\u2019t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest? Why was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing? Why a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated? What are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads? My own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle\u2019s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami\u2019s Favalora, Rochester\u2019s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool\u2026 I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over. For fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church. Why have we so often seen these men \u2013 compromised intellectually and morally \u2013 elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith? The end of \u201cBig Umbrella Catholicism\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions. Maike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation \u2013 in which each, of the so-called \u201cSankt Gallen Mafia\u201d prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: \u201cIt was characteristic of the church\u2019s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.\u201d When journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being \u2013 as his Wikipedia page puts it \u2013 \u201cone of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.\u201d And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we\u2019re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times. There\u2019s a \u201cliberal wing\u201d and a \u201cconservative wing\u201d and they\u2019re both Catholic. Steve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole \u201cemeritus pope\u201d charade was an error: \u201cI think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error. By playing along, by pretending that we could be \u201cconservative Catholics\u201d in this New Paradigm that also includes \u201cliberal Catholics\u201d we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history. Because of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church\u2019s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a \u201cbig umbrella\u201d with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal \u201ctaste\u201d \u2026that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth. This schizophrenia is the model under which \u201cconservatives\u201d have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a \u201cconservative champion of orthodoxy.\u201d And what has this achieved? It created cover for the men of Kasper\u2019s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago. And just like that, the jargon of \u201ctolerance\u201d and the \u201cbig umbrella\u201d is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun. As it had to. They, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand \u2013 and frequently say out loud \u2013 that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same. And their New Church is the only one left. For five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don\u2019t talk about it, there isn\u2019t a problem. Ottaviani\u2019s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church \u2013 and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger. We had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left. One of the things I\u2019ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era. We were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the \u201cNew Springtime of Vatican II,\u201d while we watched these wolves in shepherds\u2019 clothing eating the sheep. Now we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness. For those still wondering, Bergoglio isn\u2019t a shock, he isn\u2019t even a surprise; he\u2019s just the logical end result. This pontificate isn\u2019t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.  ",

The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 are substantial and serious. She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes. Here\u2019s the core of her story: While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. \u201cI thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u201d said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California. \u201cHe was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u201d Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh\u2019s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling. She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house. Do not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault. I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale. This isn\u2019t \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d Actions have consequences, and it\u2019s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this \u2014 even a long time ago \u2014 he has to remain \u201cmerely\u201d a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Since Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot. At the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying. Yet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred. We don\u2019t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court. I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton \u2014 or for any other politician who\u2019s accused of misconduct. Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true? Given the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment. I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault. I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls. But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men. So far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment. Here\u2019s why: First, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration. Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred? With Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration. Here, there was not. According to the Washington Post, \u201cFord said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.\u201d That\u2019s almost three decades of silence \u2014 three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change. But even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem. They actually contradict her story on a key detail. According to the Post, \u201cThe notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist\u2019s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.\u201d Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions. Those are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect. As a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails. Juries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes \u2014 after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn\u2019t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome. At least the investigation seems somewhat manageable. If there were only four boys there, who were the other two? Let\u2019s hear from them. In fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party. Yet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party? Would they remember any details at all? If someone saw Kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party, that would obviously bolster Ford\u2019s account. If another attendee says, \u201cHe was totally sober and with me the whole time,\u201d that helps Kavanaugh. But the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie \u2014 for either person\u2026.  ",

The pictures are often gorgeously detailed eye candy, but the latest batch of images from the space agency is remarkable for an entirely different reason. Captured by NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft, the images were gathered at a greatest distance from Earth than any in the history of mankind. So, just how far is \u201cthe farthest ever\u201d? Right around 3.79 billion miles. Yeah, it\u2019s kind of crazy. There are three images in total, each focusing on a different distant object. The subjects include the \u2018Wishing Well\u2019 star cluster as well as two large objects in the Kuiper Belt which have never been observed from such a distance before. \u201cNew Horizons has long been a mission of firsts \u2014 first to explore Pluto, first to explore the Kuiper Belt, fastest spacecraft ever launched,\u201d New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, notes in a statement. \u201cAnd now, we\u2019ve been able to make images farther from Earth than any spacecraft in history.\u201d The images, as seen above (Kuiper Belt objects) and below (Wishing Well cluster), are somewhat grainy and not the most detailed we\u2019ve seen from NASA, but that doesn\u2019t make the feat any less remarkable. New Horizons originally launched way back in early 2006, and it the spacecraft has made close passes of a number of planets during its more than a decade of cruising through our Solar System. Its primary mission was set to last roughly 10 years, but was extended once it became clear that the spacecraft was healthy enough to continue sending back observations for a while longer. Its new extended mission will wrap up in early 2021 after it performs a number of flybys of large objects in the Kuiper Belt that scientists want to learn more about. However, that might not be the last we hear from New Horizons, as its power source could continue to provide life into 2026 and beyond. If it makes it that long, NASA plans to use the spacecraft to study the outer heliosphere.  ",

This massive Democrat voter fraud could be the end of our free republic. \u201cTop FL County Election Official Illegally Let People Vote Over Fax, Email,\u201d by Randy DeSoto, Western Journal, November 13, 2018 (thanks to Mark): The top election official in heavily Republican Bay County allowed residents displaced by Hurricane Michael to vote by email and fax, contrary to Florida law. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and others are expressing outrage at the special provision made for these voters. The Miami Herald reported that Bay County Supervisor of Elections Mark Andersen said on Monday that 11 ballots were accepted by email and 147 were faxed in, though Florida law only permits those serving in the military overseas to use these methods\u2026. According to the Herald, Gov. Rick Scott issued an executive order on Oct. 18 allowing election supervisors in Bay County and other counties impacted by the storm to extend early voting days and designate more early voting locations, but did not make provision for voting by fax or email. Speaking at an African American church in Boynton Beach in Palm Beach County, north of Miami, on Monday night, Gillum expressed outrage that Anderson broke election laws and allowed these approximately 150 Floridians to vote by fax or email, The Associated Press reported. \u201cThese are the stories that we know,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cImagine the ones that we don\u2019t.\u201d Meanwhile, Gillum along with Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson continue to call for all the votes to be counted in heavily Democratic Broward and Palm Beach counties, despite election officials in both missing state mandated deadlines in providing vote tallies. President Donald Trump tweeted late last week, \u201cMayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him \u2018back in play.\u2019 Bill Nelson conceded Election \u2014 now he\u2019s back in play!?

        "content": "No Justice for Kate Steinle  A San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015. The jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm. For Garcia\u2019s Zarate\u2019s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader\u2019s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump. \u201cFor those who might criticize this verdict \u2013 there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,\u201d Gonzalez said after the verdict, \u201cthe Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States. Let me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.\u201d \u201cFrom day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,\u201d added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte. \u201cIt was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others. I believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.\u201d Alex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor\u2019s office told reporters the verdict \u201cwas not the one we were hoping for,\u201d but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution. \u201cWe\u2019re just shocked \u2014 saddened and shocked ... that\u2019s about it,\u201d Jim Steinle, Kate\u2019s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way you can coin it. Justice was rendered, but it was not served.\u201d Kate\u2019s brother Brad was \u201cstunned that they couldn\u2019t even get him on using the weapon.\u201d Attorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant\u2019s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter. The verdict, Wohl said, was \u201can utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.\u201d Conservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was \u201chorrifying. . . Politics trumps evidence in California once again.\u201d For Jeff Sessions San Francisco\u2019s sanctuary city policy \u201cled to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.\u201d According to the Attorney General\u2019s statement, the Justice Department \u201cwill continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens.\u201d For his part, President Trump tweeted: \u201cA disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.\u201d Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times. In 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation. San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national. On July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old. The Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers. During the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate\u2019s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution. As Gonzalez argued, \u201cIf this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?\u201d That sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family. The felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years. Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks. San Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation. Should that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law. He has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight. When that happens, the killer\u2019s public defender will call it a \u201cvindication for the rights of immigrants.\u201d In San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of \u201cno justice, no peace.\u201d  ",

        "content": "Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: \u2018The Religion of the Qur\u2019an Is a Religion of Peace\u2019  Outside of specialists and seekers, the only reason why there is general interest in the Qur\u2019an among non-Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism. With What the Qur\u2019an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us: What did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels? Some people are sure it is there, though it isn\u2019t. Then what does it say about Shari\u2019ah law? Not a thing (p. 7). That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness. Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments \u201cRobert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur\u2019an\u201d (p. 58). I have never called for such a ban, and oppose in principle the banning of any book. Wills, not surprisingly, does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim. His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur\u2019an. Wills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur\u2019an, which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur\u2019anic incitement and hatred. For example, he quotes 5:51 -- \u201cYou who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies\u201d (p. 114) -- but he nonetheless concludes, after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain, that \u201cthe Qur\u2019an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths\u201d (p. 124). Wills never mentions Qur\u2019an 9:29, which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia. Wills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur\u2019an. He renders one key passage in this way: \u201cFight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God\u201d (2:193; p. 133). Whence the bracketed interpolation \u201cat the shrine\u201d? Wills doesn\u2019t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself. By adding \u201cat the shrine\u201d to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca. He ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims. The prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way: The worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator. To eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah. Wills doesn\u2019t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them. Likewise, when he claims that the Qur\u2019an has \u201cnot a thing\u201d to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur\u2019an is one of the sources of Sharia. The Qur\u2019an\u2019s declarations that a woman\u2019s testimony is worth half that of a man\u2019s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who \u201cwage war against Allah and his messenger\u201d are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions. Because these stipulations are found in the Qur\u2019an, they cannot be questioned or set aside. Throughout his book, Wills\u2019 assurances that the Qur\u2019an is not really as bad as \u201cright-wing Islamophobes\u201d say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny. Again and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case. He asks why the Qur\u2019an is \u201cso ferocious to \u2018hypocrites\u2019 and apostates\u201d (p. 124). Then he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that \u201cif we sin again on purpose\u201d there is \u201conly a terrifying judgment to come\u201d (p. 126). Wills concludes: \u201cThe Qur\u2019an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God\u2019s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness\u201d (p. 126). That sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur\u2019an is more merciful than the New Testament. Until one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur\u2019an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur\u2019anic passage on this topic: take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper (4:89). To \u201cemigrate in the cause of Allah\u201d is to leave one\u2019s home and join up with the Muslims. This passage envisions some of the disbelievers becoming Muslim, and then turning away again, whereupon the Muslims are told to \u201ckill them wherever you find them.\u201d God\u2019s inexhaustible mercy, indeed. Wills\u2019 peaceful fantasy Qur\u2019an raises one massive question that the author does not and cannot answer: if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it? The Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur\u2019an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book\u2019s core tenets. ISIS quoted the Qur\u2019an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur\u2019an-based tax, cf. Qur\u2019an 9:29); in justifying the execution of accused spies; and in its various videos. ISIS also awarded $10,000 prizes and sex slaves in Qur\u2019an memorization contests. One of its underground lairs was found littered with weapons and copies of the Qur\u2019an. Children in the Islamic State study the Qur\u2019an and get weapons training. One Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur\u2019an led him to join the Islamic State. A Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur\u2019an. An Islamic State propagandist\u2019s parents said of him: \u201cOur son is a devout Muslim. He had learnt the Quran by heart.\u201d A Muslim politician from Jordan said that the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cdoctrine stems from the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah.\u201d How would Garry Wills explain all that? He can\u2019t; he has just explained all Qur\u2019anic violence and intolerance away, leaving the manifest fact that all too many Muslims worldwide think that the Qur\u2019an says exactly what he claims it does not say an unanswered conundrum. Wills\u2019 na\u00efve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view of the Qur\u2019an, of course, accords with that of his fellow Leftist Catholic, Pope Francis. Francis has proclaimedpreposterously that \u201cauthentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.\u201d Wills\u2019 book accords well with the present-day Catholic Church\u2019s head-in-the-sand posture toward Qur\u2019an-based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East. It isn\u2019t remotely accurate, but it feels good, and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today, that seems to be all that matters. Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer  ",

        "content": "The Eerie Silence  In a recent communication between Randy Credico, an Assange supporter, comic and radio producer, and Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, Assange\u2019s fear of arrest and extradition to the US was confirmed by the leader of the Russia-gate frenzy. Credico received the following response from Schiff after meeting the Congressman\u2019s staff, in which Credico was trying to connect Assange with Schiff: \u201cOur committee would be willing to interview Assange when he is in U.S. Custody and not before.\u201d Dennis Bernstein spoke with John Pilger, a close friend and supporter of Assange on May 29. The interview began with the statement Bernstein delivered for Pilger at the Left Forum last weekend in New York on a panel devoted to Assange entitled, \u201cRussia-gate and WikiLeaks\u201d. Pilger\u2019s Statement \u201cThere is a silence among many who call themselves left. The silence is Julian Assange. As every false accusation has fallen away, every bogus smear shown to be the work of political enemies, Julian stands vindicated as one who has exposed a system that threatens humanity. The Collateral Damage video, the war logs of Afghanistan and Iraq, the Cablegate revelations, the Venezuela revelations, the Podesta email revelations \u2026 these are just a few of the storms of raw truth that have blown through the capitals of rapacious power. The fakery of Russia-gate, the collusion of a corrupt media and the shame of a legal system that pursues truth-tellers have not been able to hold back the raw truth of WikiLeaks revelations. They have not won, not yet, and they have not destroyed the man. Only the silence of good people will allow them to win. Julian Assange has never been more isolated. He needs your support and your voice. Now more than ever is the time to demand justice and free speech for Julian. Thank you.\u201d No Place to Hide: Edwa... Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $1.49 Buy New $3.70 (as of 06:30 EDT - Details) Dennis Bernstein: We continue our discussion of the case of Julian Assange, now in the Ecuadorian embassy in Great Britain. John Pilger, it is great to talk to you again. But it is a profound tragedy, John, the way they are treating Julian Assange, this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalists have depended on in the past. He has been totally left out in the cold to fend for himself. John Pilger: I have never known anything like it. There is a kind of eerie silence around the Julian Assange case. Julian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days. He is cut off from the very tools of his trade, visitors aren\u2019t allowed. I was in London recently and I couldn\u2019t see him, although I spoke to people who had seen him. Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture. It was Correa\u2019s government that gave Julian political refuge, which has been betrayed now by his successor, the government led by Lenin Moreno, which is back to sucking up to the United States in the time-honored way, with Julian as the pawn and victim. Should be a \u2018Constitutional Hero\u2019 But really it comes down to the British government. Although he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality, his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government. The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear. Britain took part in an investigation which determined that Julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him. It is very good that you are doing this, Dennis, because even in the media outside the mainstream, there is this silence about Julian. The streets outside the embassy are virtually empty, whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you. The principles involved in this case are absolutely clear-cut. Number one is justice. The injustice done to this man is legion, both in terms of the bogus Swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can\u2019t leave without being arrested, extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole. But it is also about freedom of speech, about our right to know, which is enshrined in the United States Constitution. If the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero, actually. Instead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage! It\u2019s so ridiculous.That is the situation as I see it, Dennis. It is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly. DB: His journalistic brethren are sounding like his prosecutors. They want to get behind Russia-gate freaks like Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo, who would like to see Assange in jail forever or even executed. How do you respond to journalists acting like prosecutors, some of whom used his material to do stories? This is a terrible time for journalism. JP: You are absolutely right: It is a terrible time for journalism. I have never known anything quite like it in my career. That said, it is not new. There has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media. It has always existed, particularly in the United States. The Pulitzer Prize this year was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for witch-hunting around Russia-gate! They were praised for \u201chow deeply sourced their investigations were.\u201d Their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Like Webb The Julian Assange case reminds me of the Gary Webb case. Bob Parry was one of Gary Webb\u2019s few supporters in the media. Webb\u2019s \u201cDark Alliance\u201d series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the CIA. Later Webb was hounded by fellow journalists and, unable to find work, he eventually committed suicide. The CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him. Now, Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life. His resilience is remarkable. But he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering. Probably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations\u2014like The New York Times, which published the WikiLeaks \u201cWar Logs\u201d and \u201cCablegate,\u201d The Washington Post and The Guardian, which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting Julian. The Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden. But their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong. It was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety. Professionally, I find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things I have seen in my career. The persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks. One of Assange\u2019s great tormentors, The Guardian\u2018s Luke Harding, made a great deal of money with a Hollywood version of a book that he and David Lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source. I suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this. My understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed. They realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie. DB: One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election, that it was a hack through Julian Assange. Any serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated. And yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders\u2026this is not a part of the story! Eight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia JP: What happened to Sanders and the way that he was rolled by the Clinton organization, everybody knows that this is the story. And now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks! There\u2019s a kind of farcical element to this. I mean, none of this came from the Russians. That WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous. WikiLeaks published about 800,000 major disclosures about Russia, some of them extremely critical of the Russian government. If you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it, they will publish no matter who you are, be they the United States or Russia. DB: Randy Credico, because of his work and his decision to devote a very high-profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange, recently found himself under attack. He went to the White House Press Roast and, after having a nice discussion with Congressman Schiff, he yelled out \u201cWhat about Julian Assange?\u201d The room was packed full of reporters but Randy was attacked and dragged out. It was if everyone there was embarrassed to recognize that one of their brethren was being brutalized. JP: Randy shouted some truth. It is very similar to what happened to Ray McGovern. Ray is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled. I might suggest he is a renegade now. DB: It was hysterical to watch these four armed guards who kept shouting \u201cStop resisting, stop resisting!\u201d and they are beating the hell out of him! JP: I thought the image of Ray being hauled off was particularly telling. These four overweight, obviously ill-trained young men manhandling Ray, who is 78 years old. There was something highly emblematic about that for me. He stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture. It is both shocking and surreal, which of course the Julian Assange case is as well. But real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth. There is so much collusion now, with all these dark and menacing developments. It is almost as if the word \u201cjournalism\u201d is becoming blighted. DB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel. Then the word \u201ccollusion\u201d is quite appropriate. JP:That\u2019s the ultimate collusion. But that\u2019s collusion with silence. Never has there been a collusion like the one between the U.S. and Israel. It suggests another word and that is \u201cimmunity.\u201d It has a moral immunity, a cultural immunity, a geopolitical immunity, a legal immunity, and certainly a media immunity. We see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Israel has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return. In the media these were described as \u201cclashes.\u201d Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people. A rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted. All the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East. DB: What would you say have been the contributions that Julian Assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism? Where does he come into the picture? JP:I think it comes down to information. If you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret. The right to know what governments are doing in our name\u2014on our behalf or to our detriment\u2014is our moral right. Julian feels very passionately about this. There were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation. There were times when I said to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it?\u201d Of course, I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was \u201cno.\u201d The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks, particularly in recent years, has amounted to an extraordinary public service. I was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region. This was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup. It detailed how subversion should work. Of course, they dressed it up as human rights work and so on. I was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela. It also reminds us that so-called \u201cmeddling\u201d by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense. The word \u201cmeddling\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of action implied in this document. It is intervention in another country\u2019s affairs. WikiLeaks has done that all over the world. It has given people the information they have a right to have. They had a right to find out from the so-called \u201cWar Logs\u201d the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They had a right to find out about Cablegate. That\u2019s when, on Clinton\u2019s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers. You can see why Julian made enemies. But he should also have made a huge number of friends. This is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise. I think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression \u201cright to know.\u201d This must explain why he is attacked so much, because that is so threatening. The enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban, it is us. DB: And who can forget the release of the \u201ccollateral murder\u201d footage by Chelsea Manning? JP: That kind of thing is not uncommon. Vietnam was meant to be the open war but really it wasn\u2019t. There weren\u2019t the cameras around. It is indeed shocking information but it informs people, and we have Chelsea Manning\u2019s courage to thank for that. DB: Yes, and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement. They want to prosecute Assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in Congress, but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war? There is no end of horrific examples of what passes for journalism, in contrast to the amazing contribution that Julian Assange has made. Click here to listen to this interview.  ",

        "content": "Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government  The McGill student at the centre of anti-Semitic allegations says he\u2019s certain the climate within student government will improve, after a report into the incident was made public this week. Noah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students\u2019 Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints. They were since reinstated. A report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti-Semitic intentions. Boudreau, a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students, however, said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish. After criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus, Boudreau issued a clarification to the report, saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism, but he acknowledged there were \u201cin fact anti-Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community.\u201d Speaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday, Lew, the SSMU\u2019s vice-president of finance for the Arts, said he was initially upset with the report, but felt vindicated by Boudreau\u2019s clarification. \u201cI thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter,\u201d he said. Jewish groups had criticized Boudreau\u2019s report, saying it ignored anti-Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU. The group was urging students to vote against Lew, and two other board members who were deemed to be pro-Israel, alleging \u201clayers of corruption\u201d within the student government and favouritism in appointing board members, then singled out three members of the board \u201cwho are all either fellows at the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee, an organization whose explicit mandate is to promote pro-Israel discourse in Canadian politics, or primary organizers for the anti-BDS initiative at McGill.\u201d Boudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti-Semitic language was published prior to the vote. While Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site, the damage had already been done, Boudreau concluded. Lew said he feels vindicated to some extent, but is concerned anti-Semitism is still a problem within student government. \u201cThere have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction, but it\u2019s certainly not over,\u201d he said. In the months leading up to the vote, there had been other anti-Semitic incidents, including a tweet by Igor Sadikov, an elected representative of students in McGill\u2019s faculty of arts, saying: \u201cpunch a zionist.\u201d Among the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti-Semitism within the student government, which Lew sits on. On Wednesday, McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students. \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses.\u201d In addition to ordering the report, Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity. Rabbi Reuben Poupko, the co-chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students. However, he said any Jewish students thinking of being involved in student politics or activism \u201cwill have encounters that are profoundly disturbing and unpleasant.\u201d He said McGill is not alone in this respect, as this is a continent-wide phenomenon within student politics. Democratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an interview. Related jmagder@postmedia.com Twitter.com/JasonMagder Facebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist  ",

        "content": "\ufeffCommunion to Adulterers Promulgated as \"Authentic Magisterium\"  Last week, Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS)\u2014the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See\u2014published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin. If papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large. Concerning these guidelines that allow \"the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist\" in \"complex circumstances\" where \"limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt\" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter: \"The document is very good and completely explains the meaning of chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia. There are no other interpretations.\" Until now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an \"Apostolic Letter,\" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State. The rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents\u2014the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines\u2014to bear the character of his \"authentic Magisterium,\" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website. Hence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when \"concrete circumstances\" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared \"magisterial\" by the Holy See. The problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration. St. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: \"If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.\" The fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it. Cardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows: Rescript \"from an Audience with His Holiness\" The Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium. From the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017 Pietro Card. Parolin Secretary of State The Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: \"Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals. Some rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g. the interpretation of a law.\" It appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals. Pope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it? As reported in The Dictator Pope\u2014a remarkable new book which provides an inside look at the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history\u2014English Cardinal Cormac Murphy O\u2019Connor who was largely responsible for the vote canvassing behind Francis' election told journalist Paul Valley in 2013, \"Four years of Bergoglio would be enough to change things.\" Each day, we see new evidence that this might have been a gross understatement. We shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare \"ex-cathedra\" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as \"extraordinary magisterium.\" Should this happen, the Mystical Body would then be without its head. In an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to \"formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.\" Burke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: \"In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact.\"  ",

American Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE! | Articles  ) Forget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump\u2019s latest DACA dalliance \u2014the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work. December marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year. Simultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September. And, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low. What started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreign-born population of working age has turned into an outright retreat. This is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the Obama Regime, which saw year-over-year increases in immigrant working-age population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually, and which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway. According to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016\u2014a decline of 0.18%. This follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November. Not since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months\u2014but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding. This makes the Trump Era immigrant workforce decline especially striking. Note that this is a net figure. The year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in. About 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies. [U.S. Immigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period\u2014the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants. This helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime). The additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers\u2019 immigrant status (but not their legal status). The Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month\u2014well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey. In December 2017: Immigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93% Native-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 \u2013 up 0.27% The immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9. The native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0.. The New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell fromto(100X (120.9/106.0)) Trump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years. But by shrinking the pool of immigrants willing to do that work, he has put more money in pockets of his voters. While overall wage growth remains modest \u2013 2.5% per annum in December \u2013 Blue collar workers have beat this by a wide margin: \u201cIt is commonly said that wage stagnation contributed to an economic anxiety in middle America that carried Donald Trump into the White House\u2026Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s rise seems to have coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for the middle class. \u2026 The latest development\u2014one that will be of particular interest to Mr. Trump\u2014is that blue-collar wages have begun to rocket. \u2026In the year [2017] to the third quarter, wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers, builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers. In some cases, blue-collar pay growth now exceeds 4%\u2026\u201d Blue-collar wages are surging. Can it last?, The Economist, Magazine, November 14th 2017 Eleven months of Trump has not come close to undoing the damage done by eight years of Obama. Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years and this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election: Can't render, error Native-born American employment growth is represented by the black line, immigrant employment growth is in pink, and NVAWDI\u2014the ratio of immigrant to native-born American job growth\u2014is in blue. Another way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment rose steadily, albeit erratically, throughout the Obama years. It fell sharply in the months after the 2016 election, but roared back to Obama-era levels in the spring. Immigrants held 16.99% of total jobs in December, a significant drop from November\u2019s 17.16% share. Can't render, error A detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report. Over the last 12 months (December 2016 to December 2017): The native-born American labor force (employed plus looking for work) grew twice as fast as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%. ADVANTAGE AMERICANS as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%. American employment grew 57% faster than immigrant employment: 1.27% versus 0.81%. ADVANTAGE AMERICANS The labor-force participation rate (LPR), a sign of worker confidence and mobility, rose by 0.6 points for immigrants and was unchanged for native-born Americans. At 65.3%, the immigrant LPR this December was considerably above the native-born American rate (61.9%.) ADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS The number of unemployed Americans fell by 763,000\u2014down 12.7%, while the number of unemployed immigrants fell 129,000\u2014down by 11%. ADVANTAGE AMERICANS Another piece of good news, quite possibly connected to the shrinking of the immigrant working age population, caught our eye: The unemployment rate for black Americans fell to 6.8% in December , the lowest level since the Labor Department began tracking the figure in 1972. [ U.S. economy added 2 million jobs in 2017 , by Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, January 5, 2018] By removing foreign competitors, Trump may have done more for blacks in 11 months than Obama did in eight years. Of course, this could be affected by statistical noise\u2014and it could be undone by e.g. a DACA capitulation. But right now it increasingly appears the Trump Effect is real\u2014and achieved entirely through enhanced enforcement. What could happen if the GOP-controlled Congress woke up and enacted an immigration moratorium? Edwin S. Rubenstein (email him) is President of ESR Research Economic Consultants.  ",

Just like his promotion of voting for Republicans in the House would lead to defeating Democrats and keep the words \"Speaker Pelosi\" off our lips, Trump also said that a vote for Braun's opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly, would lead to Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) becoming the Senate Majority leader should the Democrats regain control of the Senate. The president also pointed out that Donnelly had opposed tax cuts and joined with his fellow Democrats in attacking and voting against Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. \"The people of Indiana do not have a one-week memory,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThat was a disgrace what we watched up there.\" Additionally, Trump said that Donnelly voted to provide free health care to illegal aliens and sponsored Senator Dianne Feinstein's (D-CA) \"Open Borders Bill.\" While some don't believe that Trump's base is all that energized, it seems pretty energetic to me and attacks on conservatives on social media and in search engine results have only furthered their outrage at the establishment, both Democrat and Republican. We're just days away from seeing how things turn out. There's a part of me that thinks this may actually turn out to be one of the biggest turnouts for a mid-term election that we've ever seen, but that's just my gut feeling. On Tuesday, we'll know for sure. I don't know about you, but I didn't actually like hearing the words \"Speaker Paul Ryan.\" I certainly don't want to hear \"Speaker Pelosi,\" again.  ",

In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009 for this very purpose. MEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime. They are hardly quiet about it. Coincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies\u2014during this training period\u2014until none other than Hillary Clinton suddenly removed them from the list in 2012. According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Completing this poll grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. It was widely reported that the MEK was behind the anti-government violence that erupted in Iran in January which snowballed into the situation today. Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. For over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran. Now, he\u2019s the National Security Advisor. It just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran. \u201cThere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today. I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran. The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself. And that\u2019s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\u201d Pay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran\u2019s current regime \u201cis centered in this room today.\u201d Who was in that room? Well, the entire event was actually put on by the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK. As Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism. For decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians. To recap, the formerly terrorist-classified organization MEK, trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012\u2014which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for \u201cregime change\u201d on their behalf\u2014is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3. While the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane. To see what US intervention\u2014through military support and the support of opposition groups\u2014does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America\u2019s wake. To those paying attention over the years, Trump\u2019s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report. This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense. \u201cThis is a memo that describes how we\u2019re going to take out seven countries in five years,\u201d Clark said. \u201cStarting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.\u201d All presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.

The three-mile-wide asteroid is expected to miss the Earth, but it\u2019s still labeled as \u201cpotentially hazardous,\u201d and for good reasons. With a diameter of about 3 miles, the asteroid named 3200 Phaethon (after the Greek demi-god who, according to legend, nearly set the Earth on fire) is classified as \u201cpotentially hazardous\u201d by the Minor Planet Center. The asteroid will pass within 6.5 million miles of the Earth, which is relatively close in space terms, but still around 27 times the distance of the moon. Much closer flybys have occurred in the very recent past. Scientists at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are planning to use the opportunity to obtain a detailed 3D model of the asteroid, which has a particularly irregular shape. First detected in December 2007, 3200 Phaethon is widely thought to be the parent body for the Geminid meteor shower, which is due to peak this year on the night of December 13. This would make the Geminids one of only two major meteor showers not originating from a comet; the other being the Quadrantids in January. The main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition. Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material. Comets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail. But the real question is will anyone be able to see the asteroid\u2019s close approach to our planet. According to NASA, 3200 Phaethon will be visible in small telescopes for experienced observers in areas with dark skies. It is potentially detectable for three weeks but will be at its brightest between December 11 and 21. If you don\u2019t see the asteroid itself, be sure to look out for the Geminid meteor shower, which is set to provide a spectacular show over the course of 10 nights in December, with as many as 100 shooting stars every hour.

The man, a former Marine who called himself Rick, says he was Paddock\u2019s neighbor between December 2015 and June 2016 in Mesquite, Nevada. \u201cI can tell you 100% this is not that kind of guy,\u201d said Rick, adding that he would see Paddock every other day and that the two would go to a local bar and play slot machines. \u201cHe never even told me that he owned a gun,\u201d continued the shooter\u2019s neighbor, adding that Paddock did not express any religious or political opinions during their conversations. \u201cI\u2019m not a big conspiracy theory guy, but it don\u2019t sit right,\u201d said Rick, before making the extraordinary claim that the whole shooting was a \u201cset up\u201d and that Paddock\u2019s body may have been left in the hotel room while other assailants carried out the shooting. The caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die, suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a \u201clone wolf\u201d attack. As a firearms expert, he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from. Rick said he had already contacted the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office to relay all the information he knew. Although the claims are intriguing, it is important to remember that after virtually every terror attack and mass shooting, friends and neighbors express shock that the culprit would be capable of carrying out such horrors, with some outright denying it to be possible. If Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection, he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors. However, the neighbor\u2019s claims are certain to attract more attention given that no specific motive has yet to be uncovered for the shooting. What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.

        "content": "Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge  (CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law. A criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop. The bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says. The FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said. Haig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said. Police say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others. More than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack. Investigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Douglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records. Haig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings. He is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing. The maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Haig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment. CNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case. \"My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,\" he told KNXV. The complaint Haig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest In a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show. Tracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going. Haig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing. Victor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock \"was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.\" But in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August. It's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show. The complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.

Hide Caption 30 of 30 Two law enforcement sources told CNN in October that Paddock, during the massacre, fired incendiary bullets at a 43,000-barrel fuel tank on the grounds of nearby McCarran International Airport in what investigators believe was a failed attempt to cause an explosion. Haig did not mention the incendiary rounds -- which are meant to ignite what they hit -- in Friday's news conference. Victor, his attorney, declined to comment about CNN's questions about the incendiary rounds. The complaint does not name Haig's associate. The law enforcement sources also said tracer rounds were found in Paddock's hotel room. But there was no evidence the tracer rounds were used during the attack, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about such details. Authorities have repeatedly said Paddock was the only shooter. Friday's charges do not allege that Haig knew of Paddock's intentions to kill in Las Vegas. Haig says he saw nothing suspicious Haig, an aerospace engineer and part-time ammunition reseller, said at Friday's news conference that he never saw anything suspicious in his brief interactions with Paddock. Paddock arrived at the seller's home in Mesa \"very well-dressed, very well-groomed, very polite, very respectful,\" Haig said. \"At no time did I see anything suspicious or odd or any kind of a tell, anything that would set off an alarm,\" he said. Haig also said that he received death threats after his name was revealed this week. He stressed that his sale made \"no contribution\" to the killings since Paddock didn't appear to have fired tracer rounds. \"I hope today ends (the death threats) when people realize that I wasn't in collusion with Paddock -- that I was not in any way, shape or form associated with the horrible crime that he committed,\" Haig said. Timeline of sales Haig said he sold 720 rounds of surplus US military tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after Paddock approached him or an associate at gun shows. JUST WATCHED Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out 01:00 He held Friday's news conference to protect his reputation, he and his attorney said. They gave the following timeline: \u2022 Paddock first approached Haig's table at a Las Vegas gun show sometime last year but met another person who was behind the table. \u2022 Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show, where he was selling ammunition. \u2022 Paddock took Haig's business card because the seller didn't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted. \u2022 Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig's home. \u2022 In September, Paddock arrived at Haig's home, bought the tracer ammunition and drove away. The ammunition, he said, was: \u2022 600 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, M62, tracer ammunition, manufactured by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri. \u2022 120 rounds of 5.56mm M196 tracer ammunition, manufactured by the same plant. He said the 5.56mm rounds were in their original packaging. He did not comment on the 7.62mm rounds' packaging. Before the sale, Paddock told him \"that he was going to go out to the desert and put on a light show\" with the ammunition -- that he was \"going to go out and shoot it at night with friends.\" Seller's reaction to massacre: 'Revulsion' Victor said police found his client's name and address on a box that Paddock had -- a box that Haig gave him to carry the tracer rounds he had bought. Haig said he learned of the massacre when authorities contacted him at work the next morning. \"Revulsion,\" Haig said of his reaction. \"Sickness. Horror that this man would do something like that.\" Haig spoke with investigators four times after the shooting, and has been \"fully cooperative,\" Victor said. \"This was a routine transaction to purchase a routine type of ammunition that is available in many different retail outlets throughout the state of Arizona,\" Victor said. \"After that transaction, Doug had absolutely no further contact with Mr. Paddock.\" Death threats Haig said he's received death threats since the search warrant documents were released Tuesday. \"One woman (was) screaming through my door that I should be killed and I should die,\" he told reporters at Friday's news conference. \"It's been not a lot of fun, quite frankly.\" Haig added, \"I had no contribution to what Paddock did. I had no way to see into his mind.\" Haig named as person of interest A Nevada judge on Tuesday unsealed police search warrant records -- prepared shortly after the shooting -- that mentioned two persons of interest in the case. The judge released the documents after CNN and other media outlets sued to obtain them. One person of interest, whom police had named previously, was the killer's girlfriend, Marilou Danley. Authorities subsequently cleared her publicly. The second name was redacted. But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported it had a version of the search warrant that named, without redaction, Haig as that second person. The documents didn't explain why he was a person of interest. Las Vegas police officials told CNN the department couldn't comment on Haig or any names, and referred questions to federal authorities. Sheriff has said feds were investigating someone When the search warrant documents were released this week, Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish allowed a small portion of those records to be redacted because \"there is an ongoing investigation regarding charges against another individual, arising out of information obtained in connection with the ... shooting, but not directly related to the shooting.\" In response to a question from CNN in January, the Clark County sheriff, Joe Lombardo, said federal authorities are investigating a person in the case. That person could face federal charges not directly related to the shooting within the next 60 days, the sheriff said January 19. Lombardo didn't disclose the person's name, saying those details were \"under federal grand jury disclosure\" rules. On Friday morning, before his arrest, Haig answered a reporter's question about whether he believed he was that person. \"No. I don't think it's me at all,\" Haig said.  ",

        "content": "Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook  Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced. Trump announced Tillerson\u2019s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: \u201cMike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!\u201d This is yet another big shake-up for Trump\u2019s still-young administration \u2014 and it may be the most important one to date. The move creates some big questions about both the administration\u2019s foreign policy ambitions as well as the president\u2019s relationship with the deep state. If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State, you\u2019ll like Pompeo\u2019s. Like Clinton and her Democrat allies, Pompeo has long subscribed to the belief that Russia is perpetually meddling in U.S. affairs. In fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too. While he was being confirmed as CIA chief, the former lawmaker lashed out at Russia for reasserting \u201d itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.\u201d Again, if you liked Obama-era, world-on-fire, Russians everywhere State Department shenanigans, this is your guy. Pompeo also isn\u2019t a huge fan of calling the federal government out when it is clearly violating the rights of Americans, as shown by his statements last year regarding WikiLeaks. \u201cIt is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is \u2013 a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia. In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence \u2014 the GRU \u2014 had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. And the report also found that Russia\u2019s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,\u201d he said. Pompeo favors increased U.S. involvement in Syria (hello, Russian proxy war), ratcheting pressure on Iran and regime change in North Korea. Clinton City\u2026 Moving on to Haspel, who will now be heading the CIA, nothing\u2019s looking any brighter. She\u2019s a big fan of torture, according to a 2013 Washington Post article pointed out this morning by The Intercept: IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of \u201ca management shake-up\u201d by then-Director John Brennan. As Miller documented, this official \u2014 whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time \u2014 was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA\u2019s Bush-era torture regime. As Miller put it, she was \u201cdirectly involved in its controversial interrogation program\u201d and had an \u201cextensive role\u201d in torturing detainees. Even more troubling, she \u201chad run a secret prison in Thailand\u201d \u2014 part of the CIA\u2019s network of \u201cblack sites\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhere two detainees were subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.\u201d The Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on torture also detailed the central role she played in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydah. Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations. The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as \u201cobstruction\u201d by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane. A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute. Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren\u2019t going anywhere under Trump.  ",

        "content": "Florida shooting: Gun control law moves step closer  New gun control measures for Florida have passed another legal hurdle, weeks after one of the worst school shootings in US history.  The state's House of Representatives passed a bill raising the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on all gun sales.  The bill, already passed by the Senate, now goes to the state governor.  Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February. Expelled former student Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been charged in the attack. He was formally indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday on 34 counts, including 17 counts of premeditated first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder.  He is suspected of using a legally bought AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to carry out the 10-minute attack, gunning down teachers and students.  What is in the new law? In addition to raising the age and bringing in the three-day waiting period, the legislation:  Introduces a voluntary armed \"guardian programme\" for schools, named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the Parkland shooting. It allows school personnel to be armed, subject to school district approval and specialist training Classroom teachers are excluded from carrying arms unless they have a security forces background Bans devices, such as bump stocks, that modify a semi-automatic weapon to fully automatic Raises mental health funding and increases the power to seize or ban guns under mental health concerns The legislation does not include a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons like the AR-15, despite it being a key demand of Parkland students and their parents.  Florida law already mandates a three-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle with no waiting period. The Republican-controlled House debated the bill for about eight hours on Wednesday before voting 67-50 in favour.  Has the move been welcomed? Ryan Petty, whose daughter was among those killed, hailed the House's vote in a tweet.  He said: \"We know that when it comes to preventing future acts of school violence, today's vote is just the beginning of our journey.\"  State Democratic Party legislators who backed the bill said it was necessary despite the \"poison pill\" of allowing more guns in schools under the guardian programme. Florida now joins at least six other states in allowing school employees to carry firearms.  Following the Parkland shooting, many surviving students had lobbied politicians for greater gun control.  Gun control activists will hope the Florida measures will be a turning point in their battle with the powerful National Rifle Association and others who defend firearms ownership under the Second Amendment of the US constitution.  On the day the vote passed, a 17-year-old woman student was killed in a suspected accidental shooting at a high school in Alabama.  What happens now? Governor Rick Scott will need to sign the bill, known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, into law.  It will automatically become law within 15 days unless he vetoes it.  Mr Scott has not yet said he will back it, telling reporters he would \"review the bill line by line\" and consult victims' families.  He has previously said he opposes US President Donald Trump's call to arm teachers. He had also previously opposed increasing the purchase age from 18 to 21.   ",

However, when asked by Senator Cory Booker whether or not Kavanaugh thought Ford was part of what Kavanaugh referred to as a \"political hit\" against him, Kavanaugh rightly steered clear of a public relations disaster. However, I am willing to say would he would not: Of course, she was part of it! I don't say this lightly. There are many things that we heard from Ford on Thursday that indicate there is more going on than she was willing to say. Clearly, Ford has been outed as a radical political activist who promotes baby murder and other unlawful actions. However, her story didn't exactly lend credibility except with Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of which has openly professed to sexual assault. take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

However, Ford claims she never authorized her July letter to Senator Feinstein to be made public and yet, it was. She didn't seem distraught over that. She wasn't angry it was made public. Why? She knew it would be made public. Ricki Seidman, a Democratic operative and former Clinton White House official who is now an advisor to Mrs. Ford, said in July (at roughly the same time as the letter was submitted) that she predicted a \"strategy\" forming to destroy Brett Kavanaugh. She suggested a \u201cstrategy will emerge\u201d to destroy Trump's nomination for the Supreme Court in a conference call with the American Constitution Society in July. \u201cI do think that over the coming days and weeks there will be a strategy that will emerge, and I think it\u2019s possible that strategy might ultimately defeat the nominee,\u201d Seidman said in audio that was recorded by the Republican National Committee\u2019s War Room. \u201cAnd whether or not it ultimately defeats the nominee it will, I think, help people understand why it\u2019s so important that they vote.\u201d If you think Mrs. Ford is ignorant of this considering her father works for the Central Intelligence Agency and her prior criminal political activism, then you aren't thinking clearly. Ford obviously has mental issues and that was on display on Thursday during her testimony. She clearly tried to present herself as a victim while she accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault with absolutely no evidence. Kavanaugh even responded by pointing out that even her friends said they don't recall such an incident and had literally hundreds of people commend his character as the direct opposite of what Ford claims. As I've said before, I don't support Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court on the grounds of lack of constitutional rulings, but that attack on him was orchestrated, it was political and Ford was a part of it. It's wrong. Ford didn't even think to act, according to her testimony, until Kavanaugh was on the short list, but did she go to local law enforcement? Nope. She went to her US Democrat representative, Senator Dianne Feinstein and The Washington Post. If that is not political, I don't know what is. Ford is not seeking justice nor is she seeking to do her \"civic duty.\" She is seeking to slander a man's character for something she cannot prove that she claims happened over 36 years ago. Kavanaugh's nomination was passed out of committee on Friday and will go to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote. For a quick run down of the political hit on Kavanaugh, take a look at this short synopsis by Paul Joseph Watson. Article posted with permission from The Washington Standard  ",

Douglas Haig New documents reveal the name of the second person of interest in the Las Vegas shooting. Police believe Douglas Haig may have conspired with gunman Stephen Paddock, but it's unclear if he's still under investigation. Haig sold Paddock ammunition the month before the October attack that killed 58 people dead and wounded hundreds of others. Mandalay Bay hotel staff had numerous run-ins with Vegas gunman: companyLas Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had lost money, been depressed, sheriff says Haig was contacted one day after the attack, after investigators found an Amazon box with his address on it inside Paddock's hotel room, reports CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal. But Haig says he had no idea what Paddock was planning to do when he met him just a few weeks before the massacre. Haig says he sold Paddock 720 rounds of ammunition from Haig's home gun business. \"I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,\" he said. \"He told me exactly what he wanted. I handed him a box with the ammunition in it, and he paid me and he left.\" The rounds he sold are called \"tracer ammunition\" \u2013 bullets that leave a visible trail when fired. \"He said he was going to go put on a light show. And I can't remember whether he said for or with his friends, but that's what he did say,\" Haig said. But newly released search warrant records filed last fall by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department say Haig \"may have conspired with Stephen Paddock to commit murder with a deadly weapon.\" Haig strongly denies that. \"I felt that they were hoping that they could find a connection between myself and Paddock, that would go back showing that I supplied him with most of his ammunition, possibly even some firearms,\" Haig said. \"They're not gonna find it. I talked to the guy three times.\" It's unclear whether Haig is still a person of interest, but he was the only one mentioned by name in the search warrant, other than Marilou Danley - Paddock's girlfriend. Authorities have since said they don't plan to bring charges against Danley. Las Vegas gunman's motive still unknown Haig does not blame himself, but within weeks of the massacre, he still decided to shut down his business. \"I'm still racking my brain for what did I miss. Why didn't I pick this up?\" he said. Haig, represented by his Phoenix attorneys Marc Victor and Andrew Marcantel, has not been charged. His attorneys say he continues to cooperate with investigators. CBS News reached out to the FBI and other authorities involved, but none will comment on an active investigation.  ",

        "content": "Ex-Sailor Pardoned By Trump Says He\u2019s SUING Obama And Comey  A former Navy sailor, who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump, is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials. Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, says he was subject to unequal protection of the law. Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked. He has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton\u2019s emails. According to Fox News, Saucier argues that the same officials who sought out punishment to Saucier for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information. Saucier\u2019s lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others. Saucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009. He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine\u2019s propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera. \u2013Fox News \u201cThey interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,\u201d Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free. Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren\u2019t treated as criminals. We want them to correct the wrong.\u201d Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December. There is usually a six-month period that must elapse before the lawsuit actually is actually filed. \u201cMy case was usually something handled by military courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,\u201d he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons. \u201cWith a pardon, there\u2019s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,\u201d Saucier said, \u201cBut I try to stay positive and look forward.\u201d Saucier has had cars repossessed and is in debt due to the loss of income after having a felony on his record. The government actively destroyed his life an made it all but impossible for his family to get back on track. But Hillary Clinton is running around free, to this day. And that is what Saucier is so burnt about, with good reason.  ",

        "content": "The Sun Is Going DARK: No Sunspots For 96 Days; Ice Age Approaches  NASA\u2019s own data is showing that the star our globe revolves around is dimming. With no sunspots reported in 96 days, the sun is going dark and the evidence could point to an approaching ice age. As the sun gets successively more blank with each day, due to lack of sunspots, it is also dimming, says the website Watts Up With That? According to data from NASA\u2019s Spaceweather, so far in 2017, 96 days (27%) of the days observing the sun have been without sunspots. Today at Cape Canaveral, SpaceXlaunched a new sensor to the International Space Station named TSIS-1. Its mission: to measure the dimming of the sun\u2019s irradiance. It will replace the aging SORCE spacecraft. NASA SDO reports that as the sunspot cycle plunges toward its 11-year minimum, NASA satellites are tracking a decline in total solar irradiance (TSI). \u2013Watts Up With That? The Daily Sheeple\u2019s Joe Joseph breaks it down for those who don\u2019t closely follow the sun\u2019s changes. He says there is a correlation between major changes on the sun and the behavior of the Earth, especially now as it reaches its 11-year-cycle\u2019s solar minimum. \u201cI guess you could say, in a very generalistic sense\u2026and I mean, this is as vanilla as you can possibly make it\u2026that as the sun gets quieter so does our magnetic field get weaker or so it appears to be,\u201d says Joseph. \u201cIs there a mini ice age coming? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. But other sources say it\u2019s more than possible that we will see a mini ice age in the next three years due to the dimming of our sun. A 15-YEAR long mini ice age could be due to hit the Northern hemisphere in just four years as the sun prepares for \u201chibernation\u201d \u2013 triggering a barrage of cataclysmic events, says The Express UK in 2016. Solar activity, measured by the appearance of sun spots, has been declining at a greater rate than at any other time in history. And that could have widespread implications. A team of experts have warned that huge seismic events, including volcanic eruptions, plunging global temperatures and destabilization of the Earth\u2019s crust will become more common after worrying changes to the surface of the Sun were recorded. Research by the The Space and Science Research Center in Florida revealed a strong link between low solar activity and seismic events. Scientists say that it could take up to 15 years for solar activity to return to normal with extreme weather and freezing temperatures continuing until 2035. This warning will infuriate environmental campaigners who argue by 2030 the world faces increased sea levels and flooding due to glacial melt at the poles and a warming of the globe.  ",

However, unlike Jupiter\u2019s centuries-old storm, Neptune\u2019s hurricane-like weather events only last a few years at a time before eventually dissipating. Of course, that\u2019s not to say the storms are insignificant \u2014 many are large enough to swallow and entire continent here on Earth \u2014 so watching one breathe its dying gasps is still a special sight. The planet, which NASA says is the windiest in our Solar System, hosts regular storms which appear as large spots on its surface, but scientists are still at a loss as to how they actually occur. \u201cWe have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate,\u201d Agust\u00edn S\u00e1nchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains. \u201cIt is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds.\u201d The observation of this particular storm dying out is significant because it\u2019s the very first time one of Neptune\u2019s storms has been observed in such a way. It also goes against everything that scientists thought they knew about how forms on Neptune live and die. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re capturing the demise of this dark vortex, and it\u2019s different from what well-known studies led us to expect,\u201d said Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says. \u201cTheir dynamical simulations said that anticyclones under Neptune\u2019s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator. We thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator, it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity.\u201d But this storm stayed its course, dying out in a horizontal path that didn\u2019t bring it towards the Neptunian equator at all, forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new theory on the planet\u2019s weather habits.

        "content": "Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama  President Trump\u2019s summit Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki created a firestorm of controversy. President Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies. The initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted: \u201cPresident Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin. It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected \u2013 immediately.\u201d After flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin, President Trump said he has \u201cfull faith and support for America\u2019s great intelligence agencies\u201d and that he accepts \u201cour intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place.\u201d In his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki. The president said: \u201cIt should have been obvious \u2013 I thought it would be obvious \u2013 but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn\u2019t. In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word \u2018would\u2019 instead of \u201cwouldn\u2019t.\u201d The sentence should have been: I don\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 or why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia. So just to repeat it, I said the word \u2018would\u2019 instead of \u2018wouldn\u2019t\u2019 \u2026 \u201cI have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections. Unlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts \u2013 and repel \u2013 we will stop it, we will repel it \u2013 any efforts to interfere in our elections. We\u2019re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.\u201d Anyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake. His natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes. For him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one). President Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration\u2019s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election. President Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. President Trump said: \u201cPresident Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now \u2013 probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks \u2013 they knew about Russia\u2019s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it. And as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. It turned out it didn\u2019t happen that way. \u201cBy contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance \u2013 it\u2019s a very firm stance \u2013 on a strong action. We\u2019re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.\u201d There are two key facts in this statement. First, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016. The very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America. It was their duty in 2016 \u2013 not candidate Trump\u2019s. Second, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being. The Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior. The Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia. Also, President Trump\u2019s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy. Furthermore, President Trump\u2019s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin. The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has. Beyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression. When the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States. When the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle. President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York. More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons. Despite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia. Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime. Finally, a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president. We are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing. This is what led me to write my new New York Times best-selling book, \u201cTrump\u2019s America: The Truth About Our Nation\u2019s Great Comeback.\u201d With each passing month the radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more. With President Trump\u2019s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked. In fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice. Similarly, Obama-era national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack President Trump. I think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt. Whatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. These former officials attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt. Just keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV. My prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia, and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was.  ",

        "content": "FBI Can\u2019t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base  \u201cMotive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base\u201d was the Los Angeles Times headline, and this one is indeed a real mystery. A Muslim named Hafiz Kazi, according to the Times, \u201cdrove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.\u201d After scrutinizing all the evidence closely, the FBI just can\u2019t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi\u2019s motive. And that in a nutshell shows what\u2019s wrong with today\u2019s FBI. Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office, stated: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any nexus of terrorism at this point. Now the question is, why. Why was he there? What led him there? And we don\u2019t know answers to that, quite frankly.\u201d The Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed, \u201cthey found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said.\u201d Yes, what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery. The Times added that \u201cthe dead man\u2019s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of \u2018jihad\u2019 video was found on Kazi\u2019s phone.\u201d All right. No jihad video. And no \u201cnexus of terrorism,\u201d according to Sean Ragan. What is a nexus of terrorism? Ragan most likely means that investigators didn\u2019t find an ISIS membership card in Kazi\u2019s wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, \u201cI did this for Allah and Islam. Allahu akbar.\u201d Of course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI\u2019s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi\u2019s motive. In any case, a larger point is being lost here. And that is that there is a war going on. We know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians. We know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself. Even if he wasn\u2019t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad. The FBI\u2019s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption. The FBI doesn\u2019t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism. It doesn\u2019t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others. So each time something like this happens, they\u2019re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive. It\u2019s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, to see if each one\u2019s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler\u2019s war aims. Authorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues. Here again, this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room and screaming \u201cAllahu akbar.\u201d Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues among the German High Command. This willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic. How long is this comic opera going to continue? If the jihadis advance even into the FBI\u2019s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis\u2019 motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?

        "content": "Former Navy Sailor Pardoned By Trump To Sue Obama & Comey  Kristian Saucier, a former Navy sailor who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine he worked on but was later pardoned by President Donald Trump, says that he is going to pursue a lawsuit against several Obama administration members, including Former FBI Director James Comes and Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah. The same FBI that gave Hillary Clinton a pass for operating an illegal email server, which we have evidence for the fact that she sent and received classified documents through resulting in a national security breach and at least one death, but would not give the same leniency to Saucier who simply took some pictures of his submarine. Fox News reports: take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others. \u201cThey interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,\u201d Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free. Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren\u2019t treated as criminals. We want them to correct the wrong.\u201d Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December. There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed. \u201cWe\u2019ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,\u201d Daigle said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there\u2019s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.\u201d Saucier's attorneys attempted to use the Hillary Clinton defense to get him out of hot water for taking pictures of classified systems aboard the USS Alexandria in 2009. Prosecutors sloughed off the defense, saying it was essentially \u201cgrasping at highly imaginative and speculative straws in trying to further draw a comparison to the matter of Secretary Hillary Clinton based upon virtually no understanding and knowledge of the facts involved, the information at issue, not to mention any issues if intent and knowledge.\u201d Saucier confessed to taking photos of the submarine back in 2009 when he served as a 22-year-old machinist mate, saying he wanted to show the pictures to his family and future children. Following an interview with the FBI in 2012, he destroyed all evidence of the pictures, meaning the Naval Criminal Investigative Service could not confirm his claims that he did not share the photos with unauthorized people. \u201cIt was a foolish mistake by a very young man,\u201d Saucier\u2019s lawyer, Greg Rinckey, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad case because Kristian Saucier is a fine young man. We don\u2019t believe this was really his true character.\u201d \u201cMy case was usually something handled by military courts,\u201d Saucier said. \u201cThey used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,\u201d he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons. President Trump had spoken of his support of Saucier on the campaign trail and blasted the Obama administration's handling of his case. \u201cWith a pardon, there\u2019s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,\u201d Saucier said, \u201cBut I try to stay positive and look forward.\u201d That's a good attitude considering he has had his cars repossessed and is in a tremendous amount of debt due to his incarceration and now having a felony on his record. But hey, Hillary is free, right? That's all that matters, cause after all, they're (Bill and Hillary) good people, aren't they, Mr. President? I think it's great that Mr. Saucier has been pardoned, I really do, but I continue to ask what a lot of Americans continue to ask, why does the known criminal Hillary Clinton remain at large in our country with her corrupt foundation taking in billions, her trashing our Republic and continuing to have a national voice? The American people weren't promised pardons, we were promised a special counsel to dig into the Clintons and bring about justice. It's time that occurred.  ",

By combining data and observations from decades of Sun research, experts are predicting a \u201cGrand Solar Minimum\u201d will occur a few decades from now, making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time. The Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it, but our star actually displays plenty of changes. The Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum). These patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there\u2019s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way. The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego. After combing the data, Lubin\u2019s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star. During a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth. This can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground. Those changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult. The grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects. The most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s. The event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over. However, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs. This temporary shakeup of temperatures could happen again, though the researchers say it will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend that mankind has created for itself.  ",

Palermo, who has done various interviews since the attack, appeared on \u201cThe Blast\u201d with a series of shocking comments that correlate with various other reports indicating that multiple shooters carried out the attack and that the FBI is actively covering this up. \u201cI definitely do believe that there was 100% more than one shooter, every other person that I\u2019ve talked to that did unfortunately get hit as well, have all said the same things,\u201d Palermo detailed. The man then goes on to explain that after being shot he ran \u201cabout 200 yards\u201d to hide behind a car, all the while hearing bullets fly past him at what he believes was ground level. \u201cI\u2019m waiting and all of a sudden we hear a little whizzing going by us, all of a sudden bullets are just flying by,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen something is coming up and down or at least from a different angle they are either going to hit the ground or\u2026 alot of different things are going to happen. When someone is shooting form a horizontal line its just going to keep shooting,\u201d Palermo attempted to explain. Take note that what he means here is that people were being shot at from ground level rather than the 32nd floor of the hotel. Palermo then specifically heard the gun shots get \u201ccloser and closer\u201d before quickly deciding it was once again time to run. Shockingly, he then goes on to detail the fact that at the end of the concert the previous two nights everyone had exited a specific way but on the night of the shooting this route was locked down shortly before the attack. \u201cEvery other night at the concert, everybody kinda exited right off Las Vegas Blvd, that was standard, that was routine, you get out of the concert and you go down to the next casino,\u201d he continued. \u201cAt 10pm they closed every exit on Las Vegas Blvd, every single one. They gated them all closed with chain-link fences, 10:08 the shooting started and we were pigs sitting in a corral. We only had one exit to go out of\u2026..everyone was just kinda following the sheep.\u201d Palermo makes clear this confused concert goers who had used the normal exits in the past. \u201cThe same exits we had came in and left Friday and Saturday night were definitely closed. There were people that went over there and tried to leave and there were cops that were telling them no, you can\u2019t go out here, you have to go the other way,\u201d he shockingly concluded. This stunning testimony is obviously a huge bombshell in the ongoing investigation of the Las Vegas mass shooting and is sure to continue to add credence to the growing belief that we are not being told what actually happened that fateful night.

        "content": "Virginia man who wanted to join ISIS pleads guilty to lying about overseas trip  NORFOLK, Va. \u2014 While texting with an FBI informant in September 2016, a Williamsburg man expressed admiration for a U.S. Army officer who shot and killed 13 soldiers on Fort Hood, Texas, according to court documents. Later that year, Shivam Patel, 28, tried to join the U.S. Army and Air Force. And in the application process, he lied to military recruiters about a recent trip he'd taken to Jordan in a failed attempt to make contact with the Islamic State and join a \"real Muslim Army,\" the documents said. Patel pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court to two counts of making false statements. He faces up to 15 years in prison when sentenced June 4. According to court documents and prosecutors, Patel \u2013 who was raised Hindu before converting to Islam several years ago \u2013 traveled to China in July 2016 to teach English. While there, however, he grew displeased with how that country treated Muslims. His employer arranged for Patel to fly back to Virginia on Aug. 23, 2016, but instead Patel chose to travel to Jordan, a statement of facts filed with his plea agreement said. Jordanian officials arrested Patel a few days later. It's unclear why, but court documents say Patel told taxi drivers and others in Jordan that he supported the Islamic State. A search of Patel's computer also showed he researched how to join the Islamic State before he left for China. Jordanian officials moved for Patel's deportation. On Sept. 2, 2016, he boarded a flight to Chicago, and the next day, he flew to Detroit. There, he met an FBI source and started talking about the Islamic State. He explained he went to Jordan in part to find like-minded Muslims, and because he wanted to do something \u201cbigger, better, and more purposeful\u201d \u2013 like dying in the cause of Allah. But, he said, he was afraid of making his parents sad. In the course of their conversations, Patel discussed his desire to see a holy war between Muslims and non-Muslims. He also sang an Islamic State fight song and recalled making a replica of the group\u2019s flag. He said he wanted to replace his neighbor\u2019s American flag with it. Patel returned to Williamsburg on Sept. 6, 2016. Shortly thereafter, he moved into a motel his parents owned and started applying for jobs with the military, as well as some paramilitary organizations \u2013 like police and fire departments, correctional facilities and probation offices. While back in Virginia, Patel stayed in touch with the FBI source. He texted the source on Sept. 23, 2016, and expressed support for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood. In the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky. He also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row. Court documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State. Simply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law. Patel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017. Court documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012. Before Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges. During the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims. Patel agreed to bring it by, but two days later he told the State Department he had accidentally thrown it away in October and needed a new one. After Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport \"near\" the motel room where he was living, the documents said. \u00a92018 The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.)

Last week, the Florida Department of State asked federal prosecutors to look into alterations made on official election documents from the 2018 midterms. Politico reported that the department points to the Florida Democratic Party for changing dates on forms used to amend absentee and mail-in ballots. These ballots would have been flagged for missing information or for being filled out with incorrect information. The amending forms, called \u201ccure affidavits,\u201d were due at 5 p.m on Nov. 5, the evening before Election Day, at the latest. During pre-Election Day absentee and mail-in voting, political parties have access to lists of people whose mail-in ballots were rejected for errors. Meanwhile, cure affidavits are publicly available and anyone can send them to voters to prompt them to \u201cfix\u201d their ballots. According to Politico, the DOS released affidavits on Tuesday, which demonstrate that four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m on Thursday, Nov. 8, past the official due date. Among the counties involved with the altered affidavits is Broward, which has been a hotspot for controversy as many Florida races have led to a recount. Some people point to Brenda Snipes, Broward\u2019s Elections chief, for her troubling history of election transgressions. Do you agree with the call for a federal investigation? Yes No Completing this poll entitles you to Conservative Tribune news updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Politico reported that they received audio of a Florida Democratic party volunteer leaving a voicemail to a voter in Palm Beach County to revise their mailed ballot after Election Day. Palm Beach County failed to make Florida\u2019s recount deadline on Thursday. Matt Dixon, bureau chief of Politico, tweeted on Wednesday that the Democratic party volunteer call came during Florida\u2019s ballot recount after ballots were allowed to be amended. \u201cWe are now doing a recount, so we want to make sure you let your vote be counted,\u201d Dixon quoted from the voicemail. It seems that Democrats may have called absentee voters about supplying them with cure affidavits after the permitted date. It also looks like whoever sent out the cure affidavits physically changed the due date to say Nov. 8, instead of Nov. 6. Bradley McVay, DOS interim general counsel, asked attorneys in Florida to investigate the conflicting dates. \u201cAltering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect \u2026 imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter\u2019s ability to vote,\u201d McVay wrote in a letter, sent on Nov. 9 and publicly released on Tuesday. According to DOS officials, they are less concerned with the inaccurate dates, and more concerned with the fact that the cure affidavits appear to have been deliberately altered. State officials turned over the altered forms to federal investigators. Of the many allegations of ballot mishandling in Florida, this is the first that has been referred to the federal government. While Democrats seem to have told voters they could fix ballot errors up to the Thursday after Election Day \u2014 these votes could not count. It looks like Democrats may have hurt their own interests by misleading their voters. They may have believed that they were supplying the correct information, but they still should not have altered official documents without verifying that they were right, which they weren\u2019t. It is yet to be determined whether the federal investigation will find Democratic ineptitude or deception in this case.  ",

        "content": "First American Citizen To Be Convicted Of Joining ISIS Gets 20 Years  The first American citizen to be convicted of successfully joining the Islamic State has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Mohamad Khweis, unlike the dozens of other people in the United States who failed to join ISIS and were subsequently charged, actually made it to Syria, but after just three months tried to escape and was captured by Kurdish forces, The Washington Post reports. Khweis is an interesting case for numerous reasons. First, there was no particular event or friend who ignited his radicalization. Second, he successfully made it to Syria via Turkey. And third, he came from a secular home that was stable. His life before joining the caliphate was unremarkable. He obtained an associate\u2019s degree in criminal justice and worked as a bus driver in Alexandria, Va. He also abused marijuana over the past few years. Khweis\u2019 defense attorney said Friday that even he has no idea what caused Khweis to join ISIS. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand,\u201d defense attorney John Zwerling said Friday. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what caused him to travel to Syria.\u201d From the very start of his trial, Khweis said he regretted his actions and said his decision to join ISIS in December 2015 was a drunken one. \u201cI hated myself for making the worst decision I ever made,\u201d Khweis wrote to the judge in a letter. \u201cI ruined my life and my family\u2019s life.\u201d Prosecutors, who pushed for 35 years in prison, accused Khweis of lying repeatedly over the last 15 months of the trial. When Khweis was first captured in Iraq in March 2016, he told the FBI that he was following a young woman. However, that young woman didn\u2019t exist. \u201cThis defendant executed his plan to perfection,\u201d prosecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick said. \u201cHe got into the Islamic State. He was in their machinery. He was providing himself and his services to the organization.\u201d Article posted with permission from The Daily Caller News Foundation  ",

By combining data and observations from decades of Sun research, experts are predicting a \u201cGrand Solar Minimum\u201d will occur a few decades from now, making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time. The Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it, but our star actually displays plenty of changes. The Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum). These patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there\u2019s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way. The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego. After combing the data, Lubin\u2019s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star. During a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth. This can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground. Those changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult. The grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects. The most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s. The event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over. However, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs. This temporary shakeup of temperatures could happen again, though the researchers say it will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend that mankind has created for itself.  ",

The Washington establishment politicians act like children when they can\u2019t have their way. They kick and scream and lie and pout. President Trump is the anti-politician and when Congress continues to behave like this, he only gets more popular. President Trump nominated Bret Kavanaugh to the supreme court. He\u2019s a pro-life judge and his vote will certainly tip the scales of justice to the right. The power that the Supreme Court has, some would argue, is greater in certain aspects than that of the president himself. Perhaps that\u2019s why the 2016 election loss was so devastating to the Democrats. Trump potentially has the ability to nominate 3 Supreme Court justices during his presidency, thus shaping the laws and morals of this country for about the next 30 years. Personally, I trust very, very few politicians no matter the party that they claim. So, when a bunch of well-documented liars come out with yet another sexual assault allegation against a Trump appointee, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m skeptical and here\u2019s why: take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

Timing The most suspicious part of this whole situation is the timing. Christine Ford recalled the incident in 2006 She's known about this for over ten years, why come forward now? She's affiliated with the democratic party and the \u201cresist\u201d movement She hired a Clinton attorney, Lisa Banks She can produce exactly zero witnesses Any one of these (and dozens of other) circumstances by themselves are not enough to dismiss this allegation outright. However, taken together as a whole, it\u2019s far too suspicious to lend it any credibility. Ladies, you demand to be believed, no matter what. Well, when every time there's a man that you don't like running for public office or being nominated for a position, some woman crawls out from a line of protesters and makes an ambiguous-at-best claim about unwanted sexual advances, it becomes increasingly difficult to take you seriously. No, an accusation against a man who has been investigated by the FBI six times prior and has 75 women publicly vouching for his character is not going to stop this process. And guess what, next time a man is nominated to a position who really has committed a crime, people will be that much less likely to believe his accuser. Way to go! By attempting to derail this process with such a pathetic attempt at a smear campaign, you have successfully made it much easier for a real sex offender to point back at this and say, \u201clook, this is what they do\"! Women everywhere should be furious. As an outsider, a regular Joe American, this is what I see: Trump nominates a very well known, well-established judge to the supreme court. Immediately every Democrat publicly stated that they would vote No for his confirmation. On the other hand, every Republican publicly stated that they would vote Yes. Currently, there's more Republicans in Congress than Democrats, which means the guy will be confirmed. There's an election 2 months away. The Democrats think that they'll take back the majority of Congress and will thus be able to block Trump's nomination. All they have to do is delay the confirmation until after the election. So, they dig up some Trump-hating woman from Kavanaugh\u2019s past and convince her to say that he assaulted her thinking that such an allegation will surely delay the vote long enough for them to regain control of Congress. It\u2019s not difficult to see through this plan. These are the facts. This is not my opinion. Everything else is just noise.  ",

        "content": "New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: \u201cRushed And Unprepared\u2026 Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head\u201d  It should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart. From shooter Paddock\u2019s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny. In the last 24 hours the Sheriff\u2019s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard. Originally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack. As it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite. As part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn\u2019t know a hotel security guard had been shot \u201cuntil they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,\u201d Lombardo said. The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor. Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said. Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor. And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities. What\u2019s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre. The hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw \u201cmultiple gunmen.\u201d The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre As of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times: The new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important: What happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren\u2019t the police rushing to the scene immediately? Why did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting? Paddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes. Police didn\u2019t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped \u2013 which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit. Moreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor? Or is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic? According to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high: Latest LV Sheriff: Saying they still don\u2019t know why he stopped shooting. @drawandstrike theory looking plausiblehttps://t.co/CQF3MZLHaN \u2014 Mr Alex ???

Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Since then, there have been numerous allegations of sexual misconduct levied toward the Justice to be. Whether or not he is guilty of these allegations is left to be determined. However, it does serve as a great distraction from his actual constitution-hating and tyrannical tendencies. While Kavanaugh may be an ostensible supporter of the Second Amendment, his record indicates that he all but cannot stand the Fourth and he\u2019s not that big a fan of the First either. While the allegations against Kavanaugh should certainly be investigated \u2014 no matter how they are being spun by the left and the right \u2014 he shouldn\u2019t even be in this position based solely on his previous record. But no one is talking about this. Instead, the left and right are involved in a mudslinging orgy of victim shaming and kangaroo courts. take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

According to this Supreme Court nominee, he thinks it is just fine and dandy for police and government to track you, spy on you, and dig through your personal life \u2014 without a warrant. On multiple occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state\u2019s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens. As Reason points out, in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant. Kavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person\u2019s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn\u2019t constitute a \u201csearch\u201d as defined by the Fourth Amendment. To Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is \u201cconstitutional.\u201d In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone\u2019s physical property, or track someone\u2019s cell phone. Luckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this. In June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant. But it gets worse. In 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA\u2019s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is \u201centirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\u201d To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens\u2019 phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure. Seriously. According to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches \u201cwithout individualized suspicion\u201d when the government demonstrates a \u201cspecial need\u201d that \u201coutweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.\u201d Exactly what this \u201cspecial need\u201d is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again. \u201cThe sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,\u201d Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh\u2019s views on the disposable nature of the constitution. Kavanaugh \u201chas no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a \u201ccounterterrorism exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement,\u201d said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program. While the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims, others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state and an enemy to privacy. Representative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed. However, this hasn\u2019t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court. \u201cPrivacy advocates must fight,\u201d Amash tweeted. \u201cThere are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations. The only question is will the Senate confirm one who is really bad on the #4thAmendment, when so much is at stake in upcoming digital privacy battles.\u201d Indeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us. The cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep. As for if Kavanaugh gets appointed, Amash has some harsh words to those who are blindly supporting him based on party lines: \u201cWhen Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, undermining our #4thAmendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, it will be too late for others to join me.\u201d Below is a video taken at the Mises Institute of Judge Napolitano explaining the implications of this enemy of the Fourth Amendment on the Supreme Court. Judge Andrew #Napolitano on Brett #Kavanaugh and the #PatriotAct At Mises University, Judge Andrew Napolitano breaks down some of the troubling parts of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's legal career. https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/15-5307/15-5307-2015-11-20.htmlLong story short, #Kavanaugh is not a friend to civil liberties or the Constitution. He helped to uphold the UnConstitutional Patriot Act which of course paved the way for the Indefinte Detention provisions of the NDAA. Auburn, Alabama; 16 July 2018.

Mohamad Jamal Khweis from Alexandria, Virginia, was convicted by a federal jury in June. The Justice Department said Khweis left the U.S. in 2015 and eventually crossed into Syria through Turkey late that year. Khweis spent 2.5 months as a member of ISIS in northern Syria. In 2016, he surrendered to Kurdish forces in northern Iraq and was eventually turned over to U.S. authorities, the department said. \u2026 The department said Khweis used encrypted devices and mobile applications to hide his activity. After joining the militant group, he agreed to be a suicide bomber, prosecutors said\u2026. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with their ideology,\u201d Khweis said in an interview with Kurdistan24 in 2016. \u201cOur daily life was basically prayer, eating, and learning about the religion for about eight hours.\u201d Kweis graduated from Alexandria\u2019s Thomas Edison High School in 2007, where friends described him as \u201cone of the guys.\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t someone who was an outcast or something like that \u2014 he was one of the guys,\u201d Harrison Weinhold told CBS News in March 2016. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything that would lead me to believe that this was, like, on the radar, that he was just going to go join ISIS.\u201d Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer  ",

Americans still have no idea what happened in Las Vegas in October. And one lawmaker is hinting that the government is covering up a big story about terrorism. During an appearance with Tucker Carlson on Fox, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said he\u2019s seen credible evidence that ISIS was involved in the devastating Las Vegas shooting. ISIS terrorists, he said, infiltrated the U.S. via the southern border prior to the attack blamed on alleged lone gunman Stephen Paddock. \u201cRecently I have been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence, credible information regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident,\u201d Perry said. Perry added that ISIS warnings of a forthcoming attack on Las Vegas prior to the shooting make a terror link even more likely. \u201cWell, they could be\u2013lets face it, ISIS twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States that they would attack Las Vegas in June and August after the attack claimed responsibility four times. Meanwhile, the local law enforcement investigative services are telling us there is no terrorist connection\u2013lone gunman, again, something is not adding up,\u201d Perry replied. An incredulous Carlson asked fellow guest Catherine Lombardo, a lawyer representing families affected by the tragedy, about the law enforcement investigation into the shooting. \u201cThe FBI and the Las Vegas metro police department have been conducting the investigation, \u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence of a terrorist attack, and I will ask with all due respect, congressman, unless have you specific evidence to back that up, it seems a bit irresponsible to make that allegation so, if you do, or make that assertion, if do you have any evidence of that, I\u2019m asking you right now to share it with us and tell us what that is. My clients\u2026 victims, all 22,000 people have been waiting and waiting and waiting for evidence.\u201d Perry noted that all Americans are still lacking all the evidence. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been waiting, and I\u2019m waiting, too. Like I said, nothing adds up, but I\u2019m just telling you, I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus, and we\u2019re gonna have to wait\u2026 until the situation develops,\u201d he said. The lawmaker said he wants the nation\u2019s counterterror agencies involved in the investigation. \u201cIf ISIS warns about an attack and then an attack occurs and claims responsibility after the fact, it seems to me that at a minimum, they should have some portion of the investigation to clearly debunk that claim and, yet, it hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said.

        "content": "UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country  The brouhaha over President Trump\u2019s retweets of videos depicting Muslims being violent continues in the UK, and is yet another manifestation of the general tendency to blame those who call attention to jihad atrocities rather than to focus upon the jihad atrocities themselves. Trump himself said it best, tweeting yesterday evening:\u201d. @ Theresa_May, don\u2019t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!\u201d . @Theresa_May, don\u2019t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017 I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re doing just fine, but Trump is right that the real problem is jihad terror and Sharia supremacism, and British authorities want to ignore that and shoot the messenger. And so Chris Bryant, \u201ca senior Labour backbencher, has written to May urging her to go further, and issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is \u2018not conducive to the public good\u2019, a senior Labour MP has said.\u201d For Chris Bryant, apparently \u201cfascism\u201d means \u201cdefense of Britain and its values against jihad terror.\u201d Bryant \u201ccited the cases of two US far-right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller , who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump.\u201d Why are we \u201cfar right\u201d? Everything we do is in defense of the freedom of speech and equality of rights of all people before the law. That\u2019s \u201cfar right\u201d? In any case, note well: the letter to me from the UK Home Office said that I was banned for saying that \u201c[Islam] is a religion and is a belief system that mandates warfare against unbelievers\u2026\u201d That\u2019s a demonstrably true statement. Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation. Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri\u2019s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain. The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: \u201cIf there\u2019s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things. One \u2013 the easiest one maybe \u2013 chop their head off, that\u2019s the easiest. Second \u2013 burn them to death. Third \u2013 throw \u2019em off a cliff. Fourth \u2013 tear down a wall on them so they die under that. Fifth \u2013 a combination of the above.\u201d May\u2019s government admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws. One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country. Chris Bryant had nothing to say about any of those jihad preachers entering Britain with no problem. \u201cUK ambassador conveys concerns over Trump retweet to White House,\u201d by Rowena Mason, Guardian, November 30, 2017: \u2026Chris Bryant, a senior Labour backbencher, has written to May urging her to go further, and issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is \u201cnot conducive to the public good\u201d, a senior Labour MP has said. Bryant, a former Foreign Office minister, said the prime minister should issue a prohibition order against the president like those that apply to other far right figures from the US. He cited the cases of two US far right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump. In a letter to May, he said: \u201cI am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country. \u201cIn retweeting Jayda Fransen\u2019s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity. This activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets. Ms Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal. Many of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this.\u201d\u2026 Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer  ",

        "content": "Avenatti\u2019s Freak Show  On the eve of a historic Supreme Court confirmation hearing, two more women have materialized out of thin air to accuse President Trump\u2019s high court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual improprieties \u2013 bringing the total number of accusers to four. Even more eleventh-hour character-assassination attempts may be coming given the enraged Left\u2019s determination to prevent the judge\u2019s ascent to the Supreme Court at all costs. Whether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people. Only the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle. They don\u2019t care about the victims they create. Only the headlines. The new allegations surfaced yesterday as the Senate Judiciary Committee battens down the hatches for a hearing today to receive oral evidence from the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student. The third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped. Incredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway. It gets weirder. Kavanaugh was a \u201cmean drunk,\u201d she stated. He drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said. Swetnick claimed to have been gang-raped at one of these parties in 1982 as a result of consuming a spiked drink that contained \u201cQuaaludes or something similar.\u201d Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at the party at which she was raped, she states, but she doesn\u2019t accuse them of participating in it. In response, Kavanaugh labeled Swetnick's salacious allegations \"ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.\" \"I don't know who this is and this never happened,\" the judicial nominee added. A CNBC summary describes Swetnick: A 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies. Swetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s \"drink excessively at many\" house parties in suburban Maryland. At the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school. She said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in \"abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,\" which \"included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent\" and \"not taking 'No' for an answer.\" Predictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either \"immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations.\" There is no indication so far that the president will oblige them. To no one\u2019s surprise, Trump\u2019s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed \u201ccreepy porn lawyer,\u201d is representing Swetnick. \"There should be an immediate investigation\" of Swetnick\u2019s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, \"and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" The president slammed Avenatti. \u201cAvenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh[,]\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe is just looking for attention and doesn\u2019t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!\u201d He rejected Swetnick\u2019s allegations as \u201canother beauty\u201d and described Avenatti as a \u201ccon artist.\u201d \u201cAll of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd then you this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.\" A fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports. According to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee: An anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner\u2019s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman \u201cup against the wall very aggressively and sexually\u201d in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states. Kavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC. Depending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh. The newspaper account continues: The transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators. And GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). Accuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday. Ramirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College. She claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her. If Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term. It normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have been only eight justices. Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court. Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans. Election Day is November 6. The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49. The proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. Committee Republicans considered the political optics and didn\u2019t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing. Democrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth. \u201cIt is going against everything I\u2019ve seen for 44 years,\" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). \"They\u2019re not following normal procedure.\" As expected, at today\u2019s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him. According to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say: I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. Kavanaugh added: \"I am innocent of this charge.\" Not surprisingly Ford\u2019s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters. \u201cI am here today not because I want to be,\u201d Ford says in her opening statement. \u201cI am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\u201d She describes the nominee as \u201cBrett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,\u201d and claims \u201cBrett\u2019s assault on me drastically altered my life,\u201d but at the same time acknowledges \u201cBrett did not rape me.\u201d Given that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome. Many commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties. Both women are college professors. Both claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles. Ford claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace. Only left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill, now an utterly undistinguished politically correct scholar who discredited herself by \u2013among other things\u2014 following her then-boss Thomas as his subordinate when he switched jobs. An abused person wouldn\u2019t do that. But all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a \u201chigh-tech lynching for uppity blacks\u201d had an effect. In the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991. With all the mud Democrats have been slinging at Kavanaugh, he would be thrilled to be approved by a margin as wide as 52 to 48. Conservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left\u2019s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him. If they can derail Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, that is an added bonus. The Left\u2019s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests: Disapproval for Kavanaugh \u2026 is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll. Those surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began. The case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee. That said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m. \"If we're ready to vote, we will vote,\u201d Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. \u201cIf we aren't ready, we won't.\u201d Obviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation. \u201cWe're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday. \"And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court.\" President Trump quoted the nation\u2019s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday: \u201cRush Limbaugh to Republicans: \u2018You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don\u2019t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.\u2019\u201d Trump is right.

She is also said to be happy in her job at Goldman. Born in Egypt and raised in the United States, Powell is well liked by Trump as well as the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

However, according to Bloomberg, Powell isn't interested in the position. She says she is just fine at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Dina Powell has told some colleagues that she\u2019s leaning against leaving the firm to rejoin the Trump administration as ambassador to the United Nations, according to two people familiar with the matter. President Donald Trump has called Powell about the job twice, first on Sunday -- before current United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley announced her resignation -- and again on Wednesday, the people said. He made it clear that he\u2019s interested in the idea of appointing Powell to the position, they said, though he has also talked to other candidates. Powell is not only a partner at Goldman Sachs, which has a sordid history of its own, but also worked in the George W. Bush administration. As for her ties with Goldman Sachs, Breitbart reported the following: 1 \u2013 When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women\u2019s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman\u2019s foundation. 2 \u2013 Powell\u2019s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects. 3 \u2013 Powell\u2019s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation. 4 \u2013 Powell\u2019s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department in a project announced by Clinton. 5 \u2013 Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign chief, John Podesta. 6 \u2013 There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell\u2019s 10,000 Women and the Clintons. 7 \u2013 Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton. 8 \u2013 In coming to Goldman Sachs, Powell joined a firm that has long been deeply tied to the Clintons. Daniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell: \u201cThe media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin. She\u2019s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations. She\u2019s friends with Valerie Jarrett\u2026.Habib Powell had all the right friends. Like Valerie Jarrett. Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in. Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin. You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal. And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO\u2019s Hanan Ashrawi\u2026.Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. Her top role at the NSC represents McMaster\u2019s vision for our approach to Islam. And it\u2019s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years. Flynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump\u2019s vision. McMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush\u2019s vision.\u201d Greenfield also adds: When visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, \u201cvisited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.\u201d \u201cI see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,\u201d she gushed. K.T. McFarland had written that \u201cGlobal Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell. Habib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. She was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi. Her achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel. While President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN, \u201cOver 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.\u201d Pamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador. Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. She is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump\u2019s agenda. Back in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared. McMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers. McMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were \u201cirreligious.\u201d McMaster forced out superb K.T. McFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib-Powell, former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett. Again, and I have asked this before, how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions? How do you drain the swamp by adding to it? The answer is clear: You don't. This would actually be the perfect time for Trump not to appoint an ambassador to the UN and call for the US to exit the anti-American organization and demand Congress stop funding it and evict the UN from US soil, but I'm not holding my breath.

        "content": "Ex-Sailor Pardoned By Trump, Sues Obama And Comey For NOT Prosecuting Hillary  The former Navy sailor pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of his submarine filed a lawsuit on Monday against Obama administration officials. The ex-sailor is alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law and cites Comey and Obama\u2019s willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama and former FBI director James Comey let Hillary off the hook before the election, while Kristian Saucier served hard time. Saucier says that that action was \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cunequal\u201d compared to the corruption and criminal activity of Hillary Clinton. Saucier told Fox News he was scapegoated by Obama officials who found themselves under fire for not aggressively responding to Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information through her private email servers. According to Fox News, Saucier\u2019s federal lawsuit alleges that the United States government was \u201coverzealous\u201d in prosecuting him for \u201cmishandling classified information\u201d while going easy on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for more serious violations of the same law. Saucier\u2019s lawsuit names as defendants former President Barack Obama, former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who led the inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email account. \u201cI could have just taken the pardon by President Trump and gone on with my life,\u201d Saucier said to Fox News, adding that he feels an obligation to get to the truth of what he sees as a double standard that let Clinton get off scot-free. \u201cThe U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights to be free from persecution by the government,\u201d Saucier said. \u201cMy conviction and subsequent sentence for a minor military infraction compared to the treatment of politically connected individuals is a glaring example of a violation of the rights of all Americans to have equal protection under the law.\u201d The former Navy sailor is acting as his own attorney after the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court New York barred his lawyer, Ronald Daigle, from practicing for one year. The court\u2019s move came just as Daigle was helping Saucier prepare to file the lawsuit, prompting the navy sailor to accuse New York officials of trying to hinder his court fight against Obama, Comey, and others. \u2013Fox News Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos of the submarine, which he said he wanted to show only to his family so that they could see where he worked. He has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton\u2019s emails.

Daniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell: \u201cThe media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin. She\u2019s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations. She\u2019s friends with Valerie Jarrett\u2026.Habib Powell had all the right friends. Like Valerie Jarrett. Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in. Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin. You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal. And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO\u2019s Hanan Ashrawi\u2026.Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. Her top role at the NSC represents McMaster\u2019s vision for our approach to Islam. And it\u2019s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years. Flynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump\u2019s vision. McMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush\u2019s vision.\u201d Greenfield also adds: When visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, \u201cvisited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.\u201d \u201cI see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,\u201d she gushed. K.T. McFarland had written that \u201cGlobal Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell. Habib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. She was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi. Her achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel. While President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN, \u201cOver 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.\u201d Pamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador. Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. She is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump\u2019s agenda. Back in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared. McMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers. McMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were \u201cirreligious.\u201d McMaster forced out superb K.T. McFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib-Powell, former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett. Again, and I have asked this before, how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions? How do you drain the swamp by adding to it? The answer is clear: You don't. This would actually be the perfect time for Trump not to appoint an ambassador to the UN and call for the US to exit the anti-American organization and demand Congress stop funding it and evict the UN from US soil, but I'm not holding my breath.

        "content": "Ex-Sailor Pardoned By Trump, Sues Obama And Comey For NOT Prosecuting Hillary  The former Navy sailor pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of his submarine filed a lawsuit on Monday against Obama administration officials. The ex-sailor is alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law and cites Comey and Obama\u2019s willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama and former FBI director James Comey let Hillary off the hook before the election, while Kristian Saucier served hard time. Saucier says that that action was \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cunequal\u201d compared to the corruption and criminal activity of Hillary Clinton. Saucier told Fox News he was scapegoated by Obama officials who found themselves under fire for not aggressively responding to Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information through her private email servers. According to Fox News, Saucier\u2019s federal lawsuit alleges that the United States government was \u201coverzealous\u201d in prosecuting him for \u201cmishandling classified information\u201d while going easy on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for more serious violations of the same law. Saucier\u2019s lawsuit names as defendants former President Barack Obama, former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who led the inquiry into Clinton\u2019s email account. \u201cI could have just taken the pardon by President Trump and gone on with my life,\u201d Saucier said to Fox News, adding that he feels an obligation to get to the truth of what he sees as a double standard that let Clinton get off scot-free. \u201cThe U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights to be free from persecution by the government,\u201d Saucier said. \u201cMy conviction and subsequent sentence for a minor military infraction compared to the treatment of politically connected individuals is a glaring example of a violation of the rights of all Americans to have equal protection under the law.\u201d The former Navy sailor is acting as his own attorney after the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court New York barred his lawyer, Ronald Daigle, from practicing for one year. The court\u2019s move came just as Daigle was helping Saucier prepare to file the lawsuit, prompting the navy sailor to accuse New York officials of trying to hinder his court fight against Obama, Comey, and others. \u2013Fox News Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos of the submarine, which he said he wanted to show only to his family so that they could see where he worked. He has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton\u2019s emails.

Senators Kamala Harris, who basically said that Judge Brett Kavanaugh was guilty because she believed Christine Blasey Ford's unsubstantiated and uncorroborated accusations against him, and Elizabeth Warren, also known as \"Fauxahontas,\" are the two members of the Senate who will be investigated. Looks like when you are so gung ho to go after someone based on 36-year-old allegations in which there are no witnesses and no evidence, it will eventually come back to bite you. Both Harris and Warren stand accused of breaking fundraising rules by sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M.

Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren for sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 even before they cast their votes against him. While voting and then asking supporters to back that decision with cash is common, the watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), says asking for money ahead of time crosses the line into vote-buying. FACT asked the Senate ethics committee to probe fundraising emails sent by Ms. Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and Ms. Harris, California Democrat. Ms. Warren\u2019s email said she was demanding a delay on the judge\u2019s confirmation vote and asked for donations for her 2018 election campaign, while Ms. Harris\u2019s emails detailed several of her actions as a member of the Judiciary Committee, including her questioning of the president\u2019s pick for the high court, and asking for contributions. The Senate's own rules prohibit this kind of behavior, but will the Senate hold these women to the standard they've set? \u201cThis is a clear violation of the Senate Ethics rules which safeguard against the appearance or actuality of elected officials \u2018cashing in\u2019 on their official position for political purposes,\u201d said Kendra Arnold, executive director of FACT. Of course, but like most of these kinds of violations, the only thing that might actually occur here is censure, and that is highly unlikely in the current climate. However, voters should be aware of the unethical practice of both of these senators. While Harris is not up for re-election this year, Warren is. Could the good people of Massachusetts do us all a favor and elect someone else in her place?  ",

During the confessional, a Canadian man by the name of Jeff detailed the fact that he and his wife were in the Bellagio Resort and Casino around 11:20pm on the night of the shooting when panic broke out in the hotels lobby. Jeff begins the interview by making clear his belief that there were multiple active shooters targeting different places in Las Vegas on the night of the attack. \u201cFirst of all, I think what needs to be said is that, from my perspective, there were multiple events that occurred around Las Vegas, up and down the Strip that night. It wasn\u2019t just centralized around the Mandalay Hotel,\u201d the witness claimed. The eyewitness then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter situation at a different hotel that authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up. \u201cMy wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10th anniversary and on October 1st we were involved in an incident with an active shooter at the Bellagio. There is no mistake in my mind about it,\u201d he continued. Jeff then describes a scene in which he and his wife were walking through the main lobby when screams and gunfire erupted. Keep in mind, this is all information that the police and the FBI has hidden from the American people. \u201cAll of a sudden there was just a crescendo of screams that started behind us in the lobby,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThen I heard somebody yell \u2018there\u2019s a shooter! There\u2019s a shooter!\u2019 And then I heard like five or six pops, like unmistakable gunfire, unmistakably.\u201d \u201cThat was about 11:20 when we heard the shots and the screams\u2026 at that point you could hear and see the screams and see hundreds of people coming towards us.\u201d Amazingly, as Shepard Ambellas noted, \u201cThe man\u2019s claims match up to actual events captured in police audio recordings from the night of the shooting which confirms that between 11:15 and 11:18 p.m. on the night of Oct. 1 there was, in fact, something going on at the Bellagio.\u201d This testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness, Rene Downs, who has spent the past few days doing interviews about a shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel. Slowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative regarding the Las Vegas Massacre be completely destroyed. At this point it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied to the American people about the worst mass shooting in our countries history. One can only speculate as to what the reasons for these lies actually are?  ",

        "content": "Former Head of DNC Aided & Abetted Muslim IT Spy, Imran Awan  One of the biggest stories of 2017 and 2018 is being ignored by the mainstream media and we all know why that is. It's because it implicates dozens of House Democrats in what could be the biggest crime of spying in US history by Muslim IT spy Imran Awan and his partners. Former head of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is on the front line of aiding and abetting Awan and his associates as has been revealed by Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller. In a lengthy report by Rosiak at The Daily Caller News Foundation, he writes: take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician? * Dianne Feinstein Maxine Waters Adam Schiff Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Kirsten Gillibrand Keith Ellison Cory Booker Email * Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

Ex-Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then\u2013IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees. The dispute came after Awan\u2019s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report. And when a House Office of Inspector General cybersecurity investigation found that Awan made \u201cunauthorized access\u201d to House servers, including the House Democratic Caucus\u2019 shortly before the election, Wasserman Schultz became \u201cfrantic, not normal,\u201d \u201cmaking the rounds\u201d to House officials in an attempt to kill the investigation, one House employee told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Awan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter, Leza \u2014 a Jewish name \u2014 and that the Florida congresswoman\u2019s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility, sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF. Wasserman Schultz cornered House Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko and called him a \u201cfucking Islamophobe,\u201d saying \u201cyou will not so much as take away their parking spots,\u201d the two House employees said Kiko told them. The congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan\u2019s whole family to her daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah and said she had \u201chelped him with a land deal,\u201d the sources said. A spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story. A 2009 article in the Pakistani publication Dawn, headlined \u201cInfluential expat shields father from long arm of law,\u201d said Awan\u2019s father was facing criminal fraud charges involving a land deal, but Awan used political connections to pressure the police into targeting the alleged victims instead. Awan\u2019s father purchased \u201chuge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,\u201d but all the checks bounced, the report said. \u201cThe police high-ups are \u2018ominously\u2019 indifferent to proceed against Awan,\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cnoteworthy\u201d how they were \u201ccomplying with the desires of\u201d Awan, who the paper described as a \u201cWhite House employee.\u201d \u201cAbout a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings \u2014 all aged between 57 and 70 \u2014 have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is father of White House employee Shahid Imran,\u201d Dawn reported. Imran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show. The police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with \u201cfrivolous\u201d cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said. \u201cMohammad Abid, a victim of [Ashraf] Awan\u2019s alleged high-profile swindling, said that [Ashraf] Awan\u2019s son had easy access to the corridors of power and that\u2019s why he was able to [pressure] the police to dance to his tunes,\u201d Dawn reported. The article details a series of people who say they were then subject to retaliation, including widow Bushra Bibi who said, \u201cnow Imran was threatening her with dire consequences.\u201d A third source, who\u2019s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened. A fourth source \u2014 a fellow House IT aide \u2014 previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved. Dr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that \u201cImran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.\u201d Ashraf Awan\u2019s business partner in the land deal, Rashid Minhas, told TheDCNF that the elder Awan gave a USB to a Pakistani senator who is a former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency, and that Imran claimed his IT position in Congress gave him the power to \u201cchange the U.S. president.\u201d Minhas is in prison for an unrelated fraud charge. On July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family. Awan, his wife, two brothers, his brother\u2019s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Florida. The finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking. In February 2017, Kiko and the House\u2019s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network. The letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence. But Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on \u201cwebsites\u201d and \u201cprinters,\u201d which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access. The congresswoman also added Awan\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network. Wasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 \u2014 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase. Her actions so rattled the Administration Committee\u2019s Democratic staff director, Jamie Fleet, that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz, his fellow Democrat, was continuing to pay the suspect, two House sources said. The story also said Wasserman Schultz had a \u201cfriendly personal relationship\u201d with Awan and Alvi. Fleet did not respond to a request for comment. Kiko said in an April 2018 hearing spurred by the scandal that he was powerless to stop members who refused to fire a bad actor. \u201cTermination, now it\u2019s the member\u2019s responsibility \u2026 We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,\u201d he said. He added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule-breaker on the government network. Wasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said. House investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence. Yet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, \u201cmy office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.\u201d Wasserman Schultz was defending someone investigators allegedly told her was suspected of cybersecurity violations, despite having resigned from her position as DNC head following a devastating hack during the 2016 election. Despite Wasserman Schultz\u2019s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 \u2014 two months after he was banned from the computer network \u2014 the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk. Capitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan\u2019s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said \u201cattorney client privilege,\u201d according to a police report. Awan\u2019s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it. That led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with \u201cconsequences\u201d for not returning the laptop. When he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police\u2019s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it. House sources told TheDCNF these exchanges were only a public glimpse into numerous such interactions, which were frequently profane, with every official she could buttonhole. One source said she also went to the Department of Justice and \u201cmade a stink.\u201d Wasserman Schultz hired the House\u2019s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard \u2014 who had recently quit the House \u2014 to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami \u2014 one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton. Wasserman Schultz\u2019 district includes much of Miami. One of Awan\u2019s lawyers told a judge he felt \u201cvery strongly\u201d that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument. Prosecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge. In August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January. Prosecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret. Capitol Police \u201crequested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn\u2019t want to tip off the employees,\u201d she said. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it. Gowen said the wire transfer instead had to do with the land deal, which he told the Washington Examiner was \u201cquickly souring.\u201d Wasserman Schultz did not respond to a request for comment.

It has become a superdogma in the Catholic Church: if you don\u2019t believe that Islam is a Religion of Peace, you will be ruthlessly harassed and silenced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the hierarchy elsewhere as well. The bishops of the Catholic Church are much more concerned that you believe that Islam is a religion of peace than that you believe in, say, the Nicene Creed. And the Pope is almost certain to ignore this heartfelt appeal, as he has ignored others who have respectfully questioned his departures from Catholic teaching. I have yet to meet a Catholic prelate who believes that the requirement to treat all charitably applies to those who hold opinions that have been deemed unacceptable. \u201cLeave them; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.\u201d (Matthew 15:14) \u201cIslamic Converts Ask Pope in Open Letter To Change His Teaching on Islam,\u201d by Steve Skojec, OnePeterFive.com, January 11, 2018: A new, open letter to the pope is making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far. \u201cMost Holy Father,\u201d it begins, \u201c\u202cMany of us \u202chave tried to contact you, \u202con many occasions \u202cand for several years, \u202cand we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.\u201d The letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is \u201ca good religion in itself\u201d as the pope \u201cseems to teach\u201d? It\u2019s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church. The signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer: You do not like to beat around the bush, and neither do we, so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam, as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium, because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ, and so is, and can only be, an Antichrist (see 1 Jn 2.22), and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation (of which Jesus would have been only a prophet). If Islam is a good religion in itself, as you seem to teach, why did we become Catholic? Do not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives? Islam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know? How is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence? \u201cWhat is the relationship between Christ and Satan? What union is there between light and darkness? What association between the faithful and the unfaithful?\u201d (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life. Are we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam? The letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation: In fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything. As a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: \u201cBetween us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!\u201d (Qur\u2019an 60.4) For the Qur\u2019an, Christians \u201care only impurity\u201d (Quran 9.28),\u201d \u201cthe worst of Creation\u201d (Qur\u2019an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur\u2019an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30). We must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5). Where the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the \u201cinfidels\u201d in exchange for his paradise: \u201cThey fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.\u201d (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you \u201cdialogue\u201d means the voice of peace, for Islam it\u2019s only another way to make war. Also, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naivet\u00e9 in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous. How can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: \u201cTo wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (\u2026) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran. \u201c(Rome, January 20, 2014)? That the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry? Should we return to Islam? The authors say that Islam can be no ally in the battle \u201cagainst the powers that want to dominate and enslave the world\u201d because \u201cthey share the same totalitarian logic based on the rejection of the kingship of Christ (Lk 4.7).\u201d They contest the idea that speaking in an \u201cIslamophilic tone\u201d will help those Christians who are suffering persecution in Muslim countries, professing that \u201capart from the fact that Jesus has never indicated any other way than that of the Cross, so that we must find our joy therein and not flee with all the damned, we do not doubt that only the proclamation of the Truth brings with it not only salvation, but freedom as well (John 8.32).\u201d The letter also contrasts the stance of Islamic countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia who \u201cdo not welcome any refugee\u201d while Pope Francis preaches the welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: \u201cIf anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him. Whoever greets him participates in his evil works.\u201d (2 John 1.10-11); \u201cIf anyone preaches to you a different Gospel, let him be accursed!\u201d (Galatians 1.8-9) The signatories go on to give voice to the utter scandal of the pope\u2019s failure to carry out his evangelical mission as the Vicar of Christ to call home the members of the Islamic faith: The pro-Islam speech of Your Holiness leads us to deplore the fact that Muslims are not invited to leave Islam, and that many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam \u2026 Thus ignorant souls are misled\u2026 Taking the matter further, they warn, too, of the physical danger the pope\u2019s disposition toward Islam invites, saying that it has resulted in Christians not preparing for a confrontation with Islam, to which St. John Paul II has called them (Ecclesia in Europa, No. 57). We are under the impression that you do not take your brother Bishop Nona Amel, Chaldean-Catholic Archbishop of Mosul in exile, seriously, when he tells us: \u201cOur present sufferings are the prelude to those that you, Europeans and Western Christians, will suffer in the near future. I have lost my diocese. The headquarters of my archdiocese and my apostolate have been occupied by radical Islamists who want us to convert or die. (\u2026) You are welcoming into your country an ever increasing number of Muslims. You are in danger as well. You must make strong and courageous decisions (\u2026). You think that all men are equal, but Islam does not say that all men are equal. (\u2026) If you do not understand this very quickly, you will become the victims of the enemy that you have invited into your home.\u201d (August 9, 2014) \u201c. This is a matter of life and death, and any complacency towards Islam is treasonous. We do not wish the West to continue with Islamization, nor that your actions contribute to it. Where then would we go to seek refuge? The signatories plea is that the pope will \u201cquickly convene a synod on the dangers of Islam.\u201d  ",

We also know that it is a conclusive fact that there was more than one shooter, according to literally dozens of eyewitnesses who have continued to come forward with what they saw that fateful night.

Currently, there are close to 3,000 migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, awaiting the arrival of other Central American migrants who will continue to travel to the U.S. southern border. There are reports that they plan to \u201crush\u201d the border knowing that some will be caught, but the larger their numbers the more will have a chance to get through. On Monday afternoon, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted out photos of CBP officers in riot gear as well as the barbed wire and barriers citing the reports about plans to \u201crush\u201d the border. . @CBP and @DeptofDefense appropriately responded by blocking the lanes, deploying additional personnel and seeking assistance from other law enforcement and federal assets. #CBP has reopened lanes for legitimate trade and travel.

Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) November 19, 2018 At one point the caravan was anywhere between 7,000 to 10,000 members strong and mostly consists of migrants with ineligible asylum claims, which include job-seekers, previously deported illegal aliens, and Central Americans looking to get away from crime. None of these are eligible asylum claims, Breitbart reports. According to the New York Times, lawyers with the National Lawyers Guild, a Soros-backed organization, are aiding the caravan migrants before they attempt to seek asylum in the U.S.: Others have begun to deal in practicalities, walking a mile from the shelter to enter their names on a waiting list for an asylum interview. Some clustered around volunteer American lawyers who arrived at the shelter to explain the basics of asylum law. [Emphasis added] \u201cPeople don\u2019t flee their country and go through the arduous trip on foot unless the situation is desperate,\u201d said Gilbert Saucedo, a Los Angeles lawyer who helped organize the volunteers through the National Lawyers Guild. [Emphasis added] \u201cI have talked to maybe 100 people today,\u201d he said on Saturday, \u201cand maybe 70 percent had credible cases on the surface.\u201d Yet many lack the documents they need to provide evidence. [Emphasis added] Last week, Breitbart News reported how caravan migrants in Tijuana began scaling the U.S.-Mexico border fence. In response, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has placed razor wire along the fence. Locals in Tijuana protested against the arrival of the caravan migrants, as Breitbart News reported, demanding they leave the city. To deal with the perceived threat the US has deployed 5,200 troops to help more than 2,000 National Guardsmen thwart what President Trump describes as an impending migrant\u201cinvasion.\u201d Over the past few weeks, the active-duty servicemen deployed under Operation Faithful Patriot have mainly been erecting barbed-wire fences along the border in Texas, California and Arizona, as well as building shelter accommodation for customs and border protection staff. To ensure the success of the military operation, in addition to sheer troop numbers, the US forces have drones, helicopters with night-vision capabilities, and fixed-wing aircraft at their disposal.

The indoctrination is getting so bad, that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing. According to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents. The paper noted that \u201cthe phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven\u2019t stopped yet.\u201d \u201cWhen the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,\u201d said coalition president Tim Lambert. \u201cIn the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled. We\u2019re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.\u201d But according to Natural News, it isn\u2019t just the rampant violence worrying some parents. That\u2019s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg. Christopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with \u201cthe violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.\u201d Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school. For example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study \u2018white privilege\u2019. The left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools. Brian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who\u2019s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents. Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment. Since teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem. \u201cMost parents homeschool for more than one reason,\u201d Ray told the paper. \u201cBut when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity. It includes all of that.\u201d Indoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically. It\u2019s the very reason the governments of the world still exist. People cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong \u2013 even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it. Governments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others. But humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries. \ufeff It isn\u2019t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves. And as schools continue to fail, and authoritarian policies continue to wreak havoc on our society, more will wake up to the absolute horror of what allowing the state to educate our children has done to the moral fabric of humanity.

However, in the day and age of unmitigated \"terrorism\" charges, once they served their sentence the federal government went after both men for more time inside their prison for profit system. Their story ultimately led to the Malheur Wildlife Refuge protest, which led to the murder of LaVoy Finicum. Now, many who have seen what took place both in the Oregon trials and the Bundy Ranch trials are calling on President Donald Trump to issue a pardon for Steve and Dwight Hammond. According to the White House petition on behalf of Dwight and Steven Hammond by Protect The Harvest: The Hammond case is viewed by many in the West, and indeed across the nation, as a manifest miscarriage of justice akin to double jeopardy. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

We respectfully ask President Trump to pardon Dwight and Steven Hammond. I completely agree with that assessment and fully support President Trump pardoning these men. They are the furthest thing from terrorists. They are hard-working, family ranchers who simply were doing their job. I've written on the Hammond's case in several articles, which you can view below. Many of you followed these stories when the mainstream wouldn't cover them. Many of you followed Bundy Ranch until after the trials, but when we asked for people to step up and sign a petition to bring Bundy Ranch prosecutor Steven Myhre to justice for his crimes, we couldn't get 1,000 signatures. Please, put yourself in the position of these humble ranchers and consider if you would appreciate someone simply taking the time to put their name on a petition to which the President of the united States might have to respond to by setting these men free.

India wants to tackle both those firsts in one fell swoop this year, with its Chandrayaan-2 mission, a trio of orbiter, lander and rover that would represent the country's second visit to the moon. The mission is scheduled to launch sometime in the first half of this year, no earlier than March. Its target is a patch of lunar surface about 370 miles away from the south pole, where scientists think the rock may be 4 billion years old, formed just after the moon's giant ocean of liquid rock began to solidify. The region is an area NASA would also like to visit, preferably with a robot that would bring souvenir rock home to Earth for scientists to analyze directly in the laboratory. But despite NASA's renewed focus on lunar exploration, as dictated in December by an order from President Trump, the agency won't beat India back to the moon. Dibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty Images That's even after India's Chandrayaan-2 mission was delayed by three years after Russia backed out of designing and producing the mission's lander. Rather than lose out on that part of the mission, the Indian Space Research Organization decided to just do it themselves. But they aren't sure how long they can expect the mission to last once the lander and rover arrive\u2014it could be over in as little as two weeks, ending as soon as the sun sets, since the mission runs on solar power and the polar area is quite shadowy even during the day. During that time, the team hopes to gather data about charged particles around the moon and the small \"moonquakes\" that ripple through its surface.

Now, scientists know that ice is likely concentrated at the poles, where it could become an important resource for human and robotic explorers alike. The orbiter piece of the upcoming mission will look to build on its predecessor by mapping how water actually moves around the moon. In the long term, India has its sights set well beyond the moon, with dreams of visiting Mars, Venus or an asteroid.  ",

The Pope Is Now Openly Attacking Child Sexual Abuse Victims For \u201cSlander\u201d  Pope Francis is now attacking the credibility of child sex abuse victims in a shocking move made at the end of a trip to Chile in which he had hoped to \u201cheal\u201d the wounds of said abuse. That\u2019s right, Pope Francis ended his trip by publicly defending a bishop who victims have accused of covering up widespread pedophilia in the country. According to a report by the Associated Press, Francis made the shocking comments in a discussion about Rev. Fernando Karadima who has been found guilty of sexually abusing a slew of minors as a member of the Catholic Church. Pope Francis accused victims of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile of slander Thursday, an astonishing end to a visit meant to help heal the wounds of a sex abuse scandal that has cost the Catholic Church its credibility in the country. Francis said that until he sees proof that Bishop Juan Barros was complicit in covering up the sex crimes of the Rev. Fernando Karadima, such accusations against Barros are \u201call calumny.\u201d The pope\u2019s remarks drew shock from Chileans and immediate rebuke from victims and their advocates. They noted the accusers were deemed credible enough by the Vatican that it sentenced Karadima to a lifetime of \u201cpenance and prayer\u201d for his crimes in 2011. A Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible, saying that while she had to drop criminal charges against Karadima because too much time had passed, proof of his crimes wasn\u2019t lacking. [\u2026] The Karadima scandal dominated Francis\u2019 visit to Chile and the overall issue of sex abuse and church cover-up was likely to factor into his three-day trip to Peru that began late Thursday. Karadima\u2019s victims reported to church authorities as early as 2002 that he would kiss and fondle them in the swank Santiago parish he ran, but officials refused to believe them. Only when the victims went public with their accusations in 2010 did the Vatican launch an investigation that led to Karadima being removed from ministry. The emeritus archbishop of Santiago subsequently apologized for having refused to believe the victims from the start. One of the victims made clear his disgust at Pope Francis for essentially covering up for a man who watched as another bishop sexually abused him. \u201cAs if I could have taken a selfie or a photo while Karadima abused me and others and Juan Barros stood by watching it all,\u201d tweeted Juan Carlos Cruz. \u201cThese people are truly crazy, and the pontiff talks about atonement to the victims. Nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty.\u201d This obviously does not look good for the Pope or the Catholic Church as they are now apparently engaging in attacking the victims instead of actually going after the abusers.

        "content": "Homeschooling Protects Children from Violence and Marxism  The February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida prompted many parents to consider homeschooling. This is hardly surprising, as the misnamed federal \u201cGun-Free Schools\u201d law leaves schoolchildren defenseless against mass shooters. Removing one\u2019s children from government schools seems a rational response to school shootings. School shootings are not the only form of violence causing more parents to consider homeschooling. Many potential homeschooling parents are concerned about the failure of school administrators to effectively protect children from bullying by other students. Of course, many parents choose homeschooling as a means of protecting their children from federal education \u201creforms\u201d such as Common Core. Other parents are motivated by a desire to protect their children from the cultural Marxism that has infiltrated many schools. take our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

The spread of cultural Marxism has contributed to the dumbing down of public education. Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education. Even if cultural Marxism did not dumb down education, concerns that government schools are indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents\u2019 political, social, and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to homeschool. Even when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left-wing ideologies, they are still implicitly biased toward big government. For example, how many government schools teach the Austrian economics explanation for the Great Depression \u2014 much less question the wisdom of central banking \u2014 or critically examine the justifications for America\u2019s hyper-interventionist foreign policy? Parents interested in providing their children with a quality education emphasizing the ideas of liberty should consider looking into my homeschooling curriculum. The Ron Paul Curriculum provides students with a well-rounded education that includes rigorous programs in history, mathematics, and the physical and natural sciences. The curriculum also provides instruction in personal finance. Students can develop superior oral and verbal communication skills via intensive writing and public speaking courses. Another feature of my curriculum is that it provides students the opportunity to create and run their own internet businesses. The government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics, libertarian political theory, and the history of liberty. However, unlike government schools, my curriculum never puts ideological indoctrination ahead of education. While government schools \u2014 and even many private schools \u2014 pretend religion played no significant role in history, my curriculum addresses the crucial role religion played in the development of Western civilization. However, the materials are drafted in such a way that any Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist parent can feel comfortable using the curriculum. Interactive forums allow students to engage with and learn from each other. The forums ensure students are actively engaged in their education as well as give them an opportunity to interact with their peers outside of a formal setting. Concern about the safety of students in government-run schools is one reason many parents are considering homeschooling, but it is not the only reason. Many parents are motivated by a desire to give their children something better than a curriculum that has been dumbed down by federal initiatives like Common Core. Other parents do not wish to have their children indoctrinated with views that contradict the parents\u2019 political, social, or even religious beliefs. I encourage all parents looking at alternatives to government schools \u2014alternatives that provide children with a well-rounded education that introduces them to the history and ideas of liberty \u2014 to go to RonPaulCurriculum.com for more information about my homeschooling program.

        "content": "An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University  \u200bDespite suffering several public and humiliating reversals in various forums and venues, those pushing for boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel have not dispensed with their pernicious campaign of hate. The latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University, where a Jewish student and two non-Jewish students identified as pro-Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU). At the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School\u2019s student society. He was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU, to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances. This is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill. The toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus. Lew followed the advice and was elected as a board member. His \u201csecret\u201d was intact. BDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel. In fact, three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed. Finally, in June 2016, SSMU\u2019s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill\u2019s undergraduate student union constitution. The Board\u2019s ruling, which is called a \u201creference,\u201d was then referred to SSMU\u2019s directors for ratification. SSMU\u2019s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the \u201creference.\u201d Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers. The malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end; or so we thought. Lew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro-Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones. Campus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called \u201cDemocratize SSMU\u201d movement. But Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic. Its raison d'\u00eatre was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU\u2019s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda. As an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against \u201cZionists.\u201d As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill\u2019s Arts Undergraduate Society. Sadikov made light of his \u201cpunch a Zionist\u201d tweet calling it a \u201cmisguided joke.\u201d It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill\u2019s Code of Conduct. McGill\u2019s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances. Democratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew\u2019s ethnicity as a reason for his removal. An enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws. In October, SSMU\u2019s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors. According to Lew, \u201chistorically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.\u201d But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol. In this manner, BDS/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time. It was repulsive display leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst. The bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts. But this time, they may have gone too far. Even by BDS standards, their manifestly anti-Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale. BDS activists generally avoid reference to \u201cJews\u201d by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute \u201cZionists\u201d for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions. But in the instant case, McGill\u2019s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews. The vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter. Even SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members. One can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action. Judging by past \u201cinvestigations\u201d conducted by other schools \u2013 SFSU, CUNY and UCI, to name a few \u2013 I am not optimistic.  ",

        "content": "Exposing the Deep State Plotters  President Trump\u2019s sweeping order this week directing intelligence agencies to declassify documents from the more than 18-month-old investigation related to the Left\u2019s electoral collusion conspiracy theory involving Trump and Russia may shed light on what really happened in the 2016 election. In an interview with Hill.TV yesterday, the president said he ordered the mass declassification to show the public that the FBI investigation of the conspiracy theory began as a \u201choax.\u201d Exposing it could be one of the \u201ccrowning achievements\u201d of his presidency, he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is a great service to the country, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope to be able to call this, along with tax cuts and regulation and all the things I\u2019ve done\u2026 in its own way this might be the most important thing because this was corrupt.\u201d Trump criticized how the FBI handled the Russia probe, accusing it of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, and of spying on his campaign. \u201cThey know this is one of the great scandals in the history of our country because basically what they did is, they used [former Trump campaign aide] Carter Page, who nobody even knew, who I feel very badly for, I think he\u2019s been treated very badly. They used Carter Page as a foil in order to surveil a candidate for the presidency of the United States.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax, beyond a witch hunt,\u201d Trump said. The documents affected involve a FISA warrant against Carter Page and text messages from disgraced ex-FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. (Carter Page is not related to Lisa Page.) Although the conspiracy theory is baseless nonsense, it continues to dog the Trump administration, providing cable television news outlets and late-night talk show hosts with endless fodder in the 24-hour news cycle. When Trump defenders have fought back, social media companies have colluded with the Left to silence and intimidate them. This declassification effort won\u2019t make things any worse than they are for President Trump. It may even prove a political masterstroke of sorts for Trump. How else does one fight back against the nameless, faceless bureaucrats of the Deep State who hide behind anonymity to undermine the duly elected 45th president of the United States? Make the documents public and let the chips fall where they may. There is so much leftist dirt to uncover. For example, it was established some time ago that former President Obama was involved on some level in this shameful un-American plot to rig the 2016 election and undermine his successor by using the privacy-invading apparatus of the state. Obama wanted \u201cto know everything\u201d the FBI was doing in its investigation into claims that Russia was interfering in the 2016 election. Specifically, the statement that Obama wanted \u201cto know everything we\u2019re doing\u201d came in a private Sept. 2, 2016, text message from FBI lawyer Lisa Page to FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she was having an extramarital affair at the time. (The exact message, time-stamped 1:50 p.m., reads \"Yes, bc potus wants to know everything we are doing.\") In a separate text message to Page, Strzok wrote something cryptic about an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d in case Donald Trump got elected. Apparently, he was referring to the salacious, unverified dossier Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid rent-a-spy Christopher Steele to compile that purports to show Trump\u2019s nefarious links to Russia. President Trump ordered that the relevant documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department \u201c[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,\u201d read a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Trump ordered the \u201cimmediate declassification\u201d of \u201cpages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W.

The letter, which is an attempt to usurp the powers vested in the president, asks the three agencies to defy the presidential directive. \"Your agencies' review, and any communication with the White House on the substance of the material, should not proceed further until you have briefed the Gang of Eight in person.\" It claims that Trump\u2019s declassification request constitutes improper intervention \u201cin an ongoing law enforcement investigation that may implicate the President himself or those around him.\u201d The authors of the letter even lie about the nature of the broad-based request, claiming Trump is selectively declassifying information to save himself. \u201cThe action he has taken, to direct your agencies to selectively disclose classified information that he believes he can manipulate publicly to undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the Special Counsel\u2019s [Robert Mueller] investigation, is a brazen abuse of power.\u201d The missive is signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Intelligence agencies have already reportedly begun working to carry out the president\u2019s orders and the first set of documents could be made public in a few days. \u201cWhen the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America\u2019s national security interests,\u201d a Justice Department official told Fox News. \u201cThe Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President\u2019s order.\u201d Coats spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was \u201cworking expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.\u201d According to Fox News: The documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant. The 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format. The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year. In comments to reporters and on Twitter, President Trump has been blasting Strzok and Page for months over their inappropriate behavior. Ditto for former FBI Director James Comey and one of his deputies, Andrew McCabe. Trump fired Comey in May 2017 and Attorney General Jeff Sessions canned McCabe in March. Page left the FBI in May and Strzok got the axe last month. That means there are still thousands of unaccountable Deep State operatives in the Trump administration that have yet to be dealt with.  ",

They\u2019re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position. These, I might add, are not what we would consider a \u201ctraditionalist\u201d community. They have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language. For obvious reasons I can\u2019t identify them, even to say what country they are in. Writing to me in English, by way of introductory comments in their longer analysis of the document that will be forthcoming, Sister T, fully professed and a senior member of the monastery\u2019s council, said, \u201cThe Cor Orans document is the death-knell of Carmel. It signals the end of the contemplative monastic life. Not only does it destroy the autonomy of the Monasteries, something Our Holy Mother St. Teresa was extremely insistent about, but it also removes the Superior, dissolves her authority and power, removes the financial independence of each Monastery, and destroys the specificity of each charism. \u201cThis is a disaster. Especially for Carmel.\u201d I contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for \u201cCor orans,\u201d Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz, the Brazilian prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015, in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation, 3 years later. In fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders. This is the programme: \u201cDo not distance yourself from the great lines of the Second Vatican Council.\u201d \u201cIn fact, those that are distancing themselves from the council to make another path are killing themselves \u2013 sooner or later, they will die. They will not have sense. They will be outside the church. We need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.\u201d After breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses \u2013 people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts. Francis and Clare, Sts. Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted. \u201cThese contexts have changed. And the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.\u201d \u201cWe must not be closed to new things. God is not static,\u201d the cardinal said. \u201cGod is always new movement \u2013 of light, of heat, of demonstration. He speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.\u201d The congregation\u2019s Secretary, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Carballo, is reported as saying, \u201cWith this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.\u201d Not the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II. And only, apparently, a single \u201cinterpretation\u201d of it, if we are to judge by the soap and oil Braz de Aviz poured on the ruffled feathers of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious \u2013 the most virulently anti-Catholic organisation of \u201cCatholic\u201d religious in the world \u2013 and by his vicious persecution of the Franciscans of the Immaculate. Carballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: \u201cA consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church \u2013 inserted in the world. Not in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,\u201d he said. It is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict: \u201cThe Prologue set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.\u201d \u201cAfter entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it. There shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: \u2018The world is crucified to me and I to the world.\u2019 \u201cLet us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us. The Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: \u2018No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.\u2019 The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it, and the words of the Imitation [of Christ] are always fulfilled: \u2018Sometimes we think to please others by our company; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.\u2019\u201d How Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila\u2019s reform of Carmel Sister T. continued, saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform. She acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations. These are already doing the Cor orans programme, having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices, \u201congoing formation\u201d courses for professed nuns, a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries. Their funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches. In 2015, Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr. Saverio Cannistra, a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology, to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers. This suggestion was rejected, to the annoyance of Maccise. Maccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries, but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices. The push for these changes is still on, however, under the current General, an Italian, Saverio Cannistr\u00e0. Given the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by \u201congoing formation\u201d is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination, sprayed over with a micro-thin layer of pious language. But for Carmelite nuns, Sister said, these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa. Authentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, \u201care essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.\u201d \u201cThey go against our Constitutions, even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions. Each Carmel has its own spirit, its own tempo, it\u2019s own \u2018feel.\u2019 Each nun is called not just to the Order, but to a specific Carmel. Formation in common is something we\u2019ve been fighting against for years.\u201d \u201cTo have a federal president who can decide to take the novices away, or take all our finances, or tell the Holy See we\u2019re no longer \u2018viable\u2019 \u2013 this is a disaster. St. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place. And now it\u2019s going to be done to us.\u201d She points to the extended length of formation for new nuns - previously six years for Carmelites and under Cor orans now nine years, as absurd, saying it will tend to impede new vocations. \u201cAs though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry. Our Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed, but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering. It will also help the monastery become \u2018less viable\u2019 because by the time anyone younger is professed, the others will be dead.\u201d Another requirement will be for a \u201creligious assistant,\u201d a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain, to be assigned by the federation. Sister writes that this was rejected \u201cyears ago\u201d by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference. The religious assistant will have unprecedented powers. Article 23 states, for instance, \u201cIn discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery. The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.\u201d \u201cOne other thing that is very striking to me is the complete loss of our rights. There are no options in this document, no choices, no recourse. It\u2019s all being done to us. In this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and \u2018choice\u2019 for all, plus the \u2018rights\u2019 of women, here our rights are completely taken away.\u201d Another nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by \u201congoing formation\u201d. Judging from other documents from already-federated Carmelites in Europe, it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take \u201ccourses\u201d together with novices from other monasteries. The content of these course, of course, is to be formulated by teams of \u201cexperts\u201d chosen by the Federation. Sister writes, \u201cCloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things. We already have to deal with the million unexpected things that come up each day. I have no idea how we are going to implement all these ridiculous plans of \u2018on-going formation\u2019. Can they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on-going formation.\u201d Apparently not. As I wrote in my first analysis piece, the document itself \u2013 that we must remember is a piece of legislation, a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do \u2013 starts by laying out its working premise: Pope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions. In other words, it is the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d of the last few decades of the Church since Vatican II that all monasteries of cloistered, contemplative nuns must now take. Anyone who imagines that this document\u2019s authors will allow leeway, that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or \u201cconservative\u201d communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei, has failed to pay attention. In the last 20 years, \u201cconservative\u201d Catholics have pointed to the flourishing \u2013 mainly in the US \u2013 of some groups of sisters who had turned away from the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d and re-established some of the traditional accoutrements of the religious life. They point to the Nashville Dominicans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Poor Clares of Alabama, where there are at least habits, (some) chant, common life and common apostolates. But it is these signs of refusal of the programme that have infuriated the despots of the New Paradigm who would not rest until every last individual house of religious life was co-opted, subverted to the new ideology. The little green shoots of hope that the faithful Catholic world so rejoiced to see are to be stamped back into the frost of Vatican II\u2019s perpetual winter. In the continuing analysis that will follow this article, we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries, now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial near-triumph. Its intention is mopping up; either to herd the remaining recalcitrants \u2013 those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of \u201cconservatives\u201d \u2013 into the full post-conciliar \u201creform\u201d instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s \u2013 or to close them. The thing is, the result will obviously be the same either way. The whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm. I have just received a document that was issued privately summarising the findings of a meeting of federated Discalced Carmelite nuns in Europe in 2009. The numbers are absolutely dismal. Federation: Belgium number of convents: 11 Number of nuns: 120 solemnly professed: 119 in formation: 1 average age: 73 Federation: Belgium - Luxembourg. number of convents: 11 number of nuns: 122 solemnly professed: 117 in formation: 5 average age: 75 Federation: Germany number of convents: 14 number of nuns: 178 solemnly professed: 170 in formation: 8 average age: 66 The rest are similar, and I\u2019ll be analysing this document in some detail in the next piece in this series, but the rest of the responses to the Father General\u2019s questionnaire tell a similar story. The German federation gave a summary of the efforts made to address these issues. \u201cPath taken: For 15 years they have organized formation courses: on-going & initial formation, and for formators. Meetings for prioresses. Present Problems: Have got very old. Some sisters are in care-homes run by Franciscans. Possible Solutions: Two convents intend to amalgamate.\u201d This is the death spiral. And it is precisely this \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d taken by nearly all the Catholic world\u2019s monastics since 1965 that Cor orans is attempting to force on the very, very few holdouts.

He\u2019s the heroic security guard that allegedly located the Las Vegas shooter, Steven Paddock. But the narrative surrounding him has changed wildly since the authorities mentioned him, and now, he\u2019s mysteriously vanished into thin air. Of course, this leads many to believe that Campos didn\u2019t even exist, to begin with. His mere existence appears to have been fabricated by the very authorities who are cramming lies down our throats about this massacre for the sake of political agendas. There are two conflicting timelines of Campos\u2019s injury, but what the media has so far made clear, is that they want the public to believe Campos was walking down the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino\u2019s 32nd floor hallway, when Stephen Paddock spotted him on a camera he\u2019d allegedly set up in a room service cart, just outside his suite. Once he saw Campos, Paddock reportedly fired nearly 200 rounds through his suite door, wounding Campos in the leg. Moments later (6 minutes actually, according to the newly revised timeline regarding Campos) Paddock allegedly opened fire on a crowd killing more than 50 and injuring nearly 500. But Campos has been a mysterious subject since being wounded in the first moments of Paddock\u2019s assault. After speaking to hotel and law enforcement officials, Campos was scheduled to appear on local Las Vegas television for an interview but went missing just moments before he was supposed to be on the air. David Hickey, a spokesman for the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA), Campos\u2019s union, said he got a text that Campos had been taken to an urgent care facility, UMC Quick Care. But UMC Quick Care says none of their clinics filled out an intake request for a patient by that name, and Campos has been silent since the text; vanishing into thin air. He also isn\u2019t listed on the registry that shows the names of licensed security guards in Nevada. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is. It\u2019s highly unusual,\u201d Hickey told media. \u201cI\u2019m hoping everything is OK with him and I\u2019m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,\u201d he said. In the meantime, authorities still have not released a conclusive timeline for the shooting they desperately want us to believe was committed by Paddock. And, according to the latest reports, are still looking for a motive for the shooting.  ",

        "content": "Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused  International financial institutions get a lot of heat for terror state ties. But this is a case where Obama Inc. tried to get them to do the wrong thing. While they did the right thing. The Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access \u2014 albeit briefly \u2014 to the U.S. financial system by sidestepping sanctions kept in place after the 2015 nuclear deal, despite repeatedly telling Congress and the public it had no plans to do so. Yet another Obama dirty deal with Iran that we're just learning about now. The question is how many more are there? And that's part of why Spygate is happening. The assault is also a cover-up. The report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016, never previously disclosed, that would have allowed Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars. If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system. The effort was unsuccessful because American banks \u2014 themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions \u2014 declined to participate. The Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion, the report said, but both refused, citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran. That's how bad Obama was on Iran. The banking system was more reluctant to help Iran launder money than he was. Nor was Obama worried about the reputational risk of loading foreign currency on unmarked cargo planes and flying it to Iran. Issuing the license was not illegal. Still, it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement. Except Obama Inc. weren't trying to drive a hard bargain. So they didn't stick to it. They were trying to aid Iran. Shortly after the nuclear deal was sealed in July 2015, then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testified that even with the sanctions relief, Iran \u201cwill continue to be denied access to the world\u2019s largest financial and commercial market.\u201d A month later, one of Lew\u2019s top deputies, Adam Szubin, testified that despite the nuclear deal \u201cIran will be denied access to the world\u2019s most important market and unable to deal in the world\u2019s most important currency.\u201d This was typical of the worthless assurances that Obama officials made. And disgraced themselves by doing so. Obama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license wouldn\u2019t be coming. But the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared, though it was never published. And when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting Iran any kind of access to the U.S. financial system, Obama-era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat in Oman had been issued two months earlier. Scandal-free administration, folks. Not a single scandal to see here. Not a one.  ",

        "content": "The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)  TO ARGUE AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY is to contend with constituted reality. Ever since Adam and Eve committed the Original Sin, every living creature is subject to it. Every one of us is born on Death Row and lives out his allotted lifespan in its shadow without hope of reprieve. God made that clear when He told Adam that \u201cin what day soever\u201d he preferred his own will above his Creator\u2019s, \u201cthou shalt die the death,\u201d condemning him sooner or later to \u201creturn to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return\u201d (Gen. 3:19). In other words, there has always been a death penalty. God instituted it, and He was the first to impose it, embedding it in the very fabric of natural law. When Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel \u201cin the field,\u201d he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone. Cain is told, \u201cWhat hast thou done? The voice of thy brother\u2019s blood crieth to me from the earth,\u201d and God curses him for his presumption by dooming him to homelessness and unproductive labor. When Cain complains that being a \u201cvagabond . . . on the earth, every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me,\u201d God laid down that \u201cwhoever shall kill Cain shall be punished sevenfold,\u201d setting a mysterious identifying mark on him to protect him from the vengeance of others. The Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses, \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d therefore dates from adamic times, when it operated as God\u2019s exclusive prerogative, allowing no exceptions.  Although men certainly continued to kill one another in a society which in fact became so wicked \"that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\" they did so as murderers, outside God's law without legal right. Only after the Flood, when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth, did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause. He told Noah, \u201cFor I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man. Whosoever shall shed man\u2019s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.\u201d In other words, from that point in history lawful killing in atonement for taking the life of another is sanctioned by God.  After the great theophany on Sinai, Moses codified the death penalty as part of the old law of talion, which in strict justice required \u201clife for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut. 19:21). The supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder, but for many other serious offenses: for adultery, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, for striking or cursing parents, for sacrificing a child to Moloch. Idolatry, fortune-telling, acting as a medium, preaching apostasy or attempting in any way to entice another from the faith were also punishable by death, as was blasphemy, an offense considered so heinous that the Law specified, \u201cHe that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger\u201d (Lev. 24:16). Death was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case, and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court.  A priest\u2019s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death (Lev. 21:9), but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning, in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal, but only society as a whole, after due judgment. Everyone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all: \u201cThe hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee\u201d (Deut. 17:7). The Law read, \u201cDefile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another\u201d (Num. 35:33).  In order to emphasize the fact that it is God, and not man, who is always the principal party to be avenged, provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found (Deut. 20:1-9). After all, it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is, but as God Himself pointed out to Noah, it is the fact that \u201cman was made to the image of God\u201d that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on God. It is therefore to God, and not to His creatures that reparation is primarily due. This point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12, 1954, when he said: A penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault: penalty and fault are action and reaction. Order violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium . . . . A word must be said on the full meaning of penalty. Most of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law. In those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty . . . . In the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being. If it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice. Today the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder. Despite the fact that it was instituted by God Himself, growing numbers of Catholics actually consider it immoral. John Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever. But doesn\u2019t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice? In the U.S., following the lead of the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and like minded prelates won to the new man-centered conciliar religion, the faithful are beginning to equate abortion, nuclear war and capital punishment as common \u201cthreats to the sacredness of human life\u201d without any reference whatever to the innocence or guilt involved. If they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic \u201ctradition which comes from the Apostles\u201d actually \u201cdevelops in the Church\u201d and keeps pace with changing times (II,8).  The circumstances pertaining to our day would therefore dictate a reassessment of the death penalty, which the new man-centered theology insists on viewing almost exclusively from the standpoint of the criminal and human society rather than from God\u2019s. At the same time, there is more and more discussion about society\u2019s responsibility for having produced criminals in the first place, together with our moral obligation to rehabilitate them rather than to wreak what is now considered a form of fruitless, guilty \u201cvengeance\u201d on them. The idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.  According to one widely held opinion, the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case, and should be discarded as impractical. What proof of this can possibly be offered? How can we know? Deterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty. To a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, \u201cThey shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother. . . that others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things. Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut. 19:19-21). And the Preacher notes that when \u201csentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear\u201d (Eccles. 8:11).  To illustrate how shallow Catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the age-old doctrine of the Church, a priest of a presumably traditional Catholic Fraternity writes in answer to a query addressed to him on the subject by saying: The death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians, but is not itself a declared dogma. Therefore it is not permissible to call those who hold it is, immoral heretics. To approach this as a dogmatic teaching is imprudent. Those who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems. Those, however, who maintain its continued use often see it more as a tool for revenge. Please consider that in anger and tragedy, the desire for revenge usually overrides reason and an honest answering of the question \u201cmust this person\u2019s life be taken to preserve society?\u201d The desire for swift and firm convictions has sent many to death who never deserved such a punishment, nor was such a punishment truly necessary for the safety of society. I do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied. Thus to call for a moratorium . . . is not unjust or incorrect. That the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge, and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument. Given the fallen human condition, such injustices are bound to occur in any judicial system, and everyone agrees that they should be ruthlessly remedied. What is not irrelevant is that the author of the letter falls headlong into the very error Pius XII warns against. Considering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal, he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded, allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him. That the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice, and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether. The supernatural dimension of the punishment as an agent for the spiritual good of both society and the criminal is furthermore not only not addressed, but treated as non-existent. This first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago. Isn't it time to subscribe to the 'paper of record' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?  The source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace. According to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed. In 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed. In the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place. At its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century. At this point, although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically, executions continue to be rare. Many nations, notably England, France, Sweden, South Africa and our neighbors Canada and Mexico, have abolished the death penalty altogether. Whether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.  What leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith and church attendance. It is sober fact that death sentences were liberally handed out in the heyday of Christendom, when the Faith was strong and governments legislated with an eye to the spiritual welfare of citizens whose sights were primarily on future bliss in heaven. In modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives. It is only to be expected that materialists\u2014for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has\u2014should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him. In their eyes this means total extinction, a penalty certainly in excess of any transgression of which he may be guilty.  Not even God completely obliterates a human existence, not even for the most odious sins, for He made the human soul immortal and hell eternal. (It might be argued, however, that if the criminal is thought to have to have totally terminated his victim, why not do the same to him?) In the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose. Justice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit. Nor was the idea of \u201crehabilitation\u201d with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned. It has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins.  As it is, the death penalty as administered by society must be viewed against the backdrop of divine revelation if it is to make any real sense. When Catholic society puts a man to death, it terminates only his temporal life on earth, catapulting him into eternity for his final judgment before almighty God. Suffering the penalty not only allows the criminal to render expiation to God and to society, but if accepted in Christ\u2019s grace with due repentance, it preserves his soul from hell and eliminates much of his purgatory. If his contrition is perfect, it\u2019s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven! In any case, neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing.  As Michel Martin pointed out in an article in Rome et d\u2019Ailleurs for September-October 1983, \u201cThe truth is that the problem of the death penalty is insoluble except from a Christian point of view.\u201d That it figured so prominently in Christian societies is due to the fact that, in the order of charity, atonement to God was sought above any atonement due to man, and the spiritual welfare of citizens above their physical well-being. Modern secularized society assumes that physical extinction is the worst thing that can happen to a human being, whereas the faith teaches that eternal damnation is incalculably worse. In the context of the faith, the importance of a man\u2019s present short life on earth cannot be compared with his future endless existence in heaven. +++ As we have seen, the death penalty has a very long history. Dating from its institution by God in Eden to its delegation after the Flood to men who would wield it in God\u2019s name, it has threaded its way without interruption through the fabric of human civilizations until these latter days. One might expect that after the Incarnation, when God became man and replaced the Old Testament\u2019s law of talion based on strict justice with a new dispensation based on love and grace, the death penalty could be safely abolished as outmoded. Converts to the prevailing conciliar religion and its \u201cNew Pentecost\u201d would in fact argue in this wise, perhaps citing the Council\u2019s famous declaration in Gaudium et Spes that, \u201cThanks to the experience of past ages ...the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened,\u201d and the world now has \u201ca keener awareness of human dignity\u201d ( 44, 73).  Far from obliterating the death penalty, however, the Incarnation only laid bare its deepest significance, hidden from the beginning. As the new dispensation\u2019s foremost theologian, St. Paul would declare, the old penalty remained very much in force: \u201cAlmost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.\u201d It is still \u201cappointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment\u201d (Heb. 9: 22,27), but now with the possibility of eternal bliss in heaven. This possibility is owed, furthermore, to a death by one of the cruelest means ever devised, unjustly inflicted on one supremely innocent Man who was God, in a miscarriage of human justice beyond any the world could ever have imagined. When God set the death penalty in Eden He pronounced it on Himself, to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures. The Cross which was its instrument is the very sign of Christianity, the only means of salvation.  Not even from the Cross did Christ decry the death penalty, either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with Him. It would continue to be dealt out to men by other men on earth, with only one significant change: Henceforth it would be administered under the authority of the glorified man who is Christ the King, as part and parcel of that universal power \u201cin heaven and on earth\u201d which He received from His Father (Matt. 28:18) after His Resurrection. From that point on it is Christ who delegates the divine authority to punish by killing, and both Scripture and tradition testify that it is lawfully wielded by those to whom He entrusts the temporal sword in His Kingdom. As He told Pontius Pilate at the time of His trial, \u201cThou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above\u201d (John 19:10).  Pope Leo XIII re-affirmed this truth in Sapientiae Christianae in 1890, when he declared that \u201ctrue and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from God the supreme Ruler and Lord of all. The Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men.\u201d Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power, it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil-doers, by death if appropriate. As St. Paul said: Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation. For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. . . For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is the minister of God: and avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil (Rom. 13:2-4). Sufficient of itself to expiate every sin which the children of Adam could ever commit, the execution of the Man-God nevertheless did not abolish the penalty of death. It continues to be the wages of sin (Rom 6:23), and men must still submit to it sooner or later by forfeiting their lives, either willingly or unwillingly. A share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us, for although our Lord\u2019s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through Baptism, it did not remove its effects. These were allowed to remain as restraints on men who, now raised to a new supernatural existence, were capable of committing incalculably more grievous sins than heretofore. As for the death penalty, it remains the inescapable consequence of our fallen nature and is of the highest utility in deterring us from following our hereditary inclination to evil.  What Christ did was to sanctify the death penalty, transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe. As St. Paul declared, \u201cDeath is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?. . . For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead. And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive\u201d (1 Cor. 15: 54-55; 21-22). The first of that numberless host of Christian martyrs who would be put to death by constituted authority for testifying to the truth, Christ commanded His disciples to \u201cFollow me!\u201d Inviting all to Calvary to \u201csuffer under Pontius Pilate\u201d with Him, He granted a meritorious share in accomplishing \u201cthe mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations, but is now made manifest to his saints\u201d to all who, like St. Paul, would \u201cnow rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things which are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body which is the church. . .\u201d (Col. 1:26, 24).  Criminals put to death undergo a penalty no different from the one exacted from the most innocent amongst us. As with everyone else the moment of death ushers them either into heaven, hell or purgatory. The most that can be said is that their lives here on earth are shortened, and they must settle their accounts sooner than expected. This could be a great mercy for them as well as for society, both in terms of expiation and protection from any future crimes they might have perpetrated. The death penalty, from the first one imposed on man by God in the beginning in Eden, to the one imposed on God by man on that Good Friday in Jerusalem, on down to those still being imposed today, transcends human legislation. By divine decree it will perdure until the end of time, when \u201cthe former things are passed away.\u201d Only then \u201cdeath shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more,\u201d and not one minute sooner. (Apo. 21:4).  ",

How else to describe the decision by Big Brother USA and junior sidekick South Korea to stage major air force exercises on North Korea\u2019s border. The prickly North Koreans had a fit, of course, as always when the US flexes its muscles on their borders. Continuing South and North Korean peace talks scheduled this week were cancelled by the furious North Koreans. The much ballyhooed Singapore summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un is now threatened with cancellation or delay. Who can blame the North Koreans for blowing their tops? As Trump administration mouthpieces were gabbing about peace and light, the US Air Force was getting ready to fly B-52 heavy bombers and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters around North Korea\u2019s borders and missile-armed subs lurked at sea.

In a policy one could call \u2018eat sand and die,\u2019 Trump demanded that Iran not only give up any and all nuclear capacity (Iran has no nukes), but also junk its non-nuclear armed medium range missiles, stop backing the Palestinians, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, roll over and be good, don\u2019t do anything to upset Israel, and pull out of Syria. In short, a total surrender policy leading to future regime change. Hardly an encouragement for North Korea. North Korea was right on target when it accused arch-neocon John Bolton of trying to sabotage the peace deal. In 2005-2006, Bolton served as the Bush administration\u2019s ambassador to the UN. He established a tradition for the post of being anti-Muslim, pro-Israel and anti-Russian, a policy continued to this day by the current US UN rep, loud-mouthed neocon Nikki Haley. In the 2005-2006 period, after years of negotiations, the US and North Korea were close to a nuclear/peace deal. Enter John Bolton. He succeeded in sabotaging the US-North Korea deal. Why? Because Bolton, as an arch neocon, was fanatically pro-Israel and feared that North Korea might provide nuclear technology to Israel\u2019s foes. As usual with the neocons, Israel\u2019s interests came before those of the United States. Trump\u2019s newly named Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, is also an ardent neocon. Last week, Bolton went onto US TV and actually suggested North Korea might follow the course set by Libya, of all places. Libya\u2019s then ruler, Muammar Kadaffi, bought some nuclear equipment from Pakistan so he could hand it over to the US as a gesture of cooperation after the Bush administration invaded Iraq. The handover was done with much fanfare, then the US, France and Britain attacked Libya and overthrew Kadaffi. The hapless Libyan leader was eventually murdered by French agents. War at the Top of the ... Eric Margolis Best Price: $2.60 Buy New $24.57 (as of 09:00 EDT - Details) Is this what Bolton has in mind for North Korea? The Northerners certainly seemed to think so. Some wondered if Bolton and perhaps Pompeo were trying to sabotage the North Korea deal. Or were at least being incredibly obtuse and belligerent. Was Trump involved in this intrigue? Hard to tell. But he can\u2019t be happy. His minions and bootlickers are promoting Trump for the Nobel Prize \u2013 rather ahead of events. Or was the US military rattling its sabers and trying to protect its huge investments in North Asia? The Pentagon takes a dim view of the proposed Korean nuclear accords. The burst of sweetness and light coming from Pyongyang just sounds too good to be true. Veteran Korea observers, this writer included, find it hard to believe Kim Jong-un will give up his nuclear weapons, particularly after seeing Trump\u2019s deceit in dealing with Iran and Kadaffi\u2019s murder. Speaking of de-nuclearization, why does North Korea not demand that the US get rid of its nuclear weapons based in South Korea, Okinawa, Guam and with the 7th Fleet? Many are targeted on North Korea. US nuclear weapons are based on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Others are secretly based in Japan. Why not demand the US pull out all its 28,500 troops in South Korea and some 2,000 military technicians at air bases? Conclusively halt those spring and fall military maneuvers that raise the threat of war. End the trade embargo of North Korea that amounts to high level economic warfare. Establish normal diplomatic relations. Pyongyang has not even begun to raise these issues. Smiles and hugs are premature. The Best of Eric Margolis  ",

        "content": "Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot  Last week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy. The issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests. Here\u2019s a look what drove the panel\u2019s creation and what to expect in the future. What is Pope Francis\u2019 commission on sexual abuse? Following criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it. O\u2019Malley was not only a member of the pope\u2019s \u201cG9\u201d group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201d The revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them. When he created the commission, Francis said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.\u201d Why is it being renewed now? After the commission\u2019s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy. O\u2019Malley returns as chief. New members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, \"reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,\u201d the Vatican said. What did the first commission achieve? The Vatican has said it \u201cworked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.\u201d What didn\u2019t it do? Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists. Even if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests\u2019 behavior, those strictures were not enough, O\u2019Malley said in 2014. \u201cThere are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,\u201d he said. The commission was behind Francis\u2019 decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests, and to fund it for five years. But amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground. In 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem. Francis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault. Any other problems? Commission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests, rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to \u201cpark\u201d the priest out of harm\u2019s way. But this simple message was hard to get across. It emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so. Did commission members persevere? Not all of them. British member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016. He said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise. Irish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission\u2019s request \u2014 approved by the pope \u2014 to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims. Marie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile. Catherine Bonnet / Associated Press Was the pope listening to the commission? Possibly not. In 2015, Collins handed O\u2019Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010. Cruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile. The pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as \u201clefties\u201d and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month. \"I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,\" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz. That was too much for O\u2019Malley, who said Francis had caused \"great pain\u201d to victims. If Francis was not listening to the commission about Barros, whom was he listening to? Vatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission. So is the pope intransigent on Barros? No. Something changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country. On Feb. 17, he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to New York to interview Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia. \"For the first time I felt that someone is listening,\" Cruz said after the meeting. What happens next? \u201cThis should lead to Barros stepping down,\u201d said Saunders, who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse. The new papal commission will meanwhile hold its first meeting in April. Support our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

        "content": "Spygate Coverup?  https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/spygate-coverup/ Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) accuses the Republican House leadership of dragging their heels in the Spygate investigation. This has been evident for months now, as there are many connections and obvious questions that haven\u2019t been investigated. The FBI files contain memos that need to be scoured too. The House leaders are Paul Ryan (Speaker of the House), Kevin McCarthy (Majority Leader), Steve Scalise (Majority Whip) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (House Republican Conference Chair). There is a decided lack of aggressiveness of this investigation. One source is Paul Ryan: Evidence: \u201cHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday that Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy was \u2018accurate\u2019 when he argued the FBI has acted appropriately in its ongoing probe of potential Russian links to the Trump campaign.\u201d How could Ryan possibly know this? Isn\u2019t he prejudging the case without even finding out what actually happened? If Ryan is correct, an investigation will show it; but the current evidence suggests he is wrong. By short-circuiting the investigation, Ryan is betraying the interest of the American people to learn what the FBI and CIA actually did against Trump. Another Republican who wants to stop investigating is former RNC Chair, Michael Steele: \u201cThere is no Spygate because there are no spies in the campaign.\u201d The attitude of Steve Scalise is wishy-washy. He\u2019s open to a special prosecutor, but his responses come across as passive, lacking push, zeal and enthusiasm to delve deeply into Spygate. There is a kind of coverup at work here in which important Republicans do not want to bolster Trump by adding substance to Spygate, and they do not want to clean up the FBI by aggressively investigating Spygate further. They don\u2019t want the rotten inner workings of the organization to be aired publicly. They want to preserve the FBI\u2019s reputation. They don\u2019t care to see Trump vindicated. The contrast with the Watergate investigation and hearings is startling. 1:33 pm on June 6, 2018 The Best of Michael S. Rozeff  ",

Hellbent to destroy President Trump, they toil in Soviet fictions and titillating porn stories. House investigators found the House server was being used for nefarious purposes and the alleged Muslim spies were removing information and sending it for foreign actors. The aides named are Imran Awan, his wife Hina Alvi, his brothers Abid and Jamal, and his friend Rao Abbas, Pakistani-born aides. Now we hear the father of Muslim spy ring Imran Awan transferred a USB drive to a Pakistani senator and former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency. CAPITOL POLICE ACCIDENTALLY GAVE EVIDENCE TO HOUSE HACKING SUSPECT\u2019S DEFENSE ATTORNEY By Luke Rosiak on May 24, 2018: The House IG said Democratic IT aides made unauthorized access to data, but prosecutors haven\u2019t charged them Democrats appear to want to keep the case out of court; a trial could expose their reckless IT practices Capitol Police didn\u2019t make arrests despite numerous red flags and then \u2018inadvertently\u2019 gave evidence to defense attorneys that was supposed to go to prosecutors Prosecutors appear to be sharing info with someone on Capitol Hill who is leaking details to the hacking suspect\u2019s lawyer The Capitol Police turned over a trove of evidence in the alleged Imran Awan House cyberbreach and theft case to the defense attorneys when they were supposed to deliver it to prosecutors instead, according to court documents and a source. And hours after The Daily Caller News Foundation asked prosecutors about the disclosure, Awan\u2019s lawyer said he had learned of the forthcoming story from a source on Capitol Hill. TheDCNF had not told anyone other than prosecutors about it. \u201cThe cop came to [Awan\u2019s defense attorney] Chris Gowen\u2019s office with a stack of papers \u2026 Then he came back and said, \u2018I thought you guys were the other party.\u2019 He was very, very angry. But Gowen made copies,\u201d the source, who\u2019s familiar with The Awans, told TheDCNF. Awan, three relatives and a friend ran IT for one in five House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until they were banned on Feb. 2, 2017, for \u201cnumerous violations of House security policies.\u201d The violations alleged by the House Office of Inspector General include logging into the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times without authorization. This allegedly occurred during the same period in 2016 the DNC was hacked. Prosecutor Michael Marando alluded to the disclosure of evidence in court on Oct. 6, 2017.

        "content": "San Francisco Show Trial Sequel  Last week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14. The jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession. Many observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse. San Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate\u2019s gun possession charge dismissed. Gonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that \u201cmomentary\u201d possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime. \u201cIf you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime,\u201d Gonzalez told reporters. The Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred. Gonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship. As he explained, \u201cI think I was a product of affirmative action,\u201d and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School. In San Francisco, Gonzalez became known as \u201cThe Great Left Hope,\u201d and a hero to Bay Area radicals. The La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA\u2019s most high-profile Stalinists. In 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. In 2003, as board president, he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall, in \u201ctraffic cone orange.\u201d As Gonzalez explained, \u201cThis is a sentiment I think all of us have had. You have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don\u2019t like.\u201d In 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom. In 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president. \u201cHe has a great, steadfast commitment to justice,\u201d Nader told reporters. On that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt. In jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three \u201cimmigrants,\u201d quite possibly false-documented illegals. True to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors. So observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted. Garcia told the court Zarate was playing his own \u201csecret version of Russian roulette,\u201d and thus parroted the defense\u2019s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance. As it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger. In a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle. In another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta. This happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead. Garcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands. After firing, he tossed the gun in the water. He said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims. Even so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter. Any observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted. Unlike Stalin\u2019s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro\u2019 trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display. Denunciations of \u201cgun violence\u201d were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak. As Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love. On the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society. In the view of Gonzalez, society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what\u2019s best for all. In this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die. As Bertolt Brecht told Sidney Hook about Stalin\u2019s victims, \u201cthe more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot.\u201d Out for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California. As defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a \u201cvindication for the rights of immigrants.\u201d Since Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter. That explains the effort of \u201cThe Great Left Hope\u201d to have his client\u2019s felony gun possession conviction tossed. Any observer of the case could believe it probably will be.  ",

        "content": "The Remnant Newspaper  The unmasking of McCarrick exposed the pervasive prelate coverup of homosexual sexual predation in the American Catholic Church. These swarmy power brokers have colluded far too long at the tragic expense of innocent boys and seminarians. For 60 years, Ted McCarrick roamed the halls of seminaries, harassing, raping, and assaulting young males around the world. His brother bishops all knew and they all stayed silent. How fortuitous and revelatory that McCarrick, the Molester would divulge his personal role in the pre-Conclave lobbying effort to elect Jorge Bergoglio as Pope. The notorious lavender mafia anxiously sought a simpatico Pope to advance its reformist homosexual agenda. Bergoglio was their man. The now well known McCarrick Villanova Speech on October 13, 2013 where he relayed the story about a prominent Italian man who met with McCarrick to ask him to lobby for the election of Bergoglio to the papacy. In light of the McCarrick scandal, the conversation takes on new meaning... McCarrick described the conversation with the Influential Roman: \u201cBefore we went into the General Congregation, a very interesting and influential Italian gentleman came to see me at the Seminary (where else?) where I was staying. We sat down and he\u2019s a very brilliant man, very influential in Rome and said he had a favor to ask of me back home in the U.S., but then he said:\u201d Influential Roman: What about Bergoglio? Molester McCarrick: I was surprised and said, What about Bergoglio? Influential Roman: Does he have a chance? Molester McCarrick: I don\u2019t think so. No one has mentioned his name. He isn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s mind. Influential Roman: He could do it you know. Molester McCarrick: What could he do? Influential Roman: He could reform the Church. If you gave him 5 years, he could get us back on target. He\u2019s 76. If he had 5 years\u2014the Lord working through him, he could make the Church over again. Molester McCarrick: That\u2019s interesting. Influential Roman: I know you are his friend. Molester McCarrick: I hope I am. Influential Roman: Talk him up. Molester McCarrick'll vouch for ya, Francis! #bromance And talk him up, McCarrick the Molester did! Oh, the irony! That the most prolific serial predator Cardinal would divulge the pre-Conclave Bergoglio plot to \u201creform the Church.\u201d Now we know what \u201creform the Church\u201d looks like in the Bergoglian papacy. Yes, the clever and tyrannical Bergoglio, through his manipulation of synods, footnotes, exhortations, personal phone calls, airplane pressers, and correspondence has nearly completed his task of modernizing the Roman Catholic Church in the past 5 years. The rallying cry for his homosexual modern agenda was sounded in his July 29, 2013 airplane presser. Who am I to judge set the tone for merciful embrace of homosexual priests. After 5 long years, his unrelenting mercy mantra seemingly extends only to homosexual clerics, not to the laity or clergy victims who protest the cover ups by prelates. Francis\u2019 wink and nod to the homosexual lifestyle landed him on the cover of the Advocate, the gay magazine, as its Man of the Year. He lapped up the accolades from the secular culture and main stream media. Yet, fame is and predation is unrelenting, even for Popes. In the words of Queen Elizabeth, this year has been annus horribilis for Francis. Excuse the gay slang pun but, the chickens have come home to roost. The cascading revelations of papal sex scandals are toppling the barque of Peter. Will Catholic laity pay attention and take action? The McCarrick scandal created an earthquake in the Catholic Church with aftershocks that will last for years. The timing is eerily propitious and providential based on the 5 year deadline. Will the laity step up and reclaim our hijacked Catholic Church? This critical time in the history of the Catholic Church demands that the laity step forward to protect the Church, its children and seminarians from predators. We must close ranks before another precious child is exploited, a holy seminarian is violated, or another homosexual orgy is covered up at the Vatican. The first order of business is to scuttle the upcoming October Synod on Young People, the Faith, and Vocational Discernment. Remember that influential Roman gentleman friend of McCarrick who said that Bergoglio could reform the Church in 5 years? Bergoglio\u2019s upcoming Synod on Young People will serve as the culminating vehicle for the 5 year modernist reform of the St. Gallen Mafia. This Synod is designed to exploit the youth, like they\u2019ve been doing for the last 60 years. If it weren\u2019t so infuriating, it would be laughable that following the McCarrick scandal of sexual predation of young males and seminarians, by a Cardinal, and covered up by Bishops, the Catholic Church would host a Synod of Bishops on the topic of young people and vocations! Furthermore, this nightmare of a \u201csinod\" is inviting youth from ages 16-29 to mingle with the Bishops to discuss the Church, faith and vocations. Are you thoroughly disgusted by this farce? The Bishops have proven that they cannot be trusted to protect young people and seminarians from predators. The ever growing global list of Bishops and Cardinals that have preyed on /and or covered up the sexual abuse of minors and seminarians over the last 60 years continues to enrage the laity. We are no longer Shocked, just fed up. Let\u2019s start with the Cardinal who will lead the upcoming Synod, none other than Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life. As the DC roommate and protege of Ted McCarrick, Farrell so respected McCarrick, the Molester, that he fashioned his Coat of Arms as a tribute to Uncle Ted. Farrell\u2019s pathetic and laughable defense \u201cI never knew anything about McCarrick\u201d video highlights the continuing conspiracy of denial by the U.S. Catholic hierarchy. Undoubtedly, Farrell as the head of this Synod chose his dear friend gay friendly, Fr. James Martin, S.J. to keynote the Synod. Farrell\u2019s graciously offers notorious praise for Martin\u2019s new book, Building a Bridge (to hell, ed.) exposes his obvious underlying homosexual agenda and aura of the upcoming Synod: \u201cA welcome and much-needed book that will help bishops, priests, pastoral associates, and all church leaders more compassionately minister to the LGBT community. It will also help LGBT Catholics feel more at home in what is, after all, their church.\u201d What merciful praise for Martin\u2019s book, Cardinal Farrell! Contrary to the theme of mercy and compassion to LGBTs, it appears that your mentor, McCarrick set out to groom and grow an LGBT community. Clearly, you and Fr. Martin have much in common since you both claimed you were \u201cshocked\u201d by the McCarrick allegations. Explain to Catholics why would you headline a homosexual affirming speaker at a Synod for youth and seminarians? In case you haven\u2019t been reading the McCarrick headlines or noticing the plunging mass attendance and collections, Catholics don\u2019t trust their boys around priests and are furious that their seminarians are subjected to unrelenting homosexual sexual harassment. McCarrick is the last straw. All credibility is lost. The October Synod is yet another example of Church leaders exploiting Catholic youth for their own personal power agenda and selfish motives. Bergoglio\u2019s five year plan is nearly complete. Catholics must shed their trust and naivety in the papacy and bishops\u2019 conference. Dare, if you will, to read the thrill, the excitement and anticipated results of the Synod in the radical New Ways Gay Catholic Ministry article, entitled, Youth Synod Document shows Vatican evolution on LGBT Topics. The article highlights the New Ways excitement over the shift in the Vatican approach to the LGBT issues at the Synod: \u201cAnother significant development is the acknowledgement that LGBT people have a desire to be part of the church. In one section, the document states: \u201csome LGBT youth \u2026 wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care from the Church.\u201d \u201cThis acknowledgement is a welcome change from the hierarchy\u2019s traditional rhetoric that suggests LGBT people are opposed to religion. As New Ways Ministry knows from over 40 years of pastoral work with the LGBT community, LGBT Catholics have a deep spirituality, often forged by remarkable journeys overcoming rejection, alienation, and marginalization. LGBT Catholics have stayed a part of the church, despite statements and actions which have offended and hurt them.\u201d The New Ways article highlights the efforts of Cardinal Kevin Farrell and his Vatican cronies to promote the LGBT agenda for the upcoming Synod: \u201cA third development is that the document shows that Vatican officials paid attention to concerns about LGBT issues which were raised by youth at a pre-synod meeting in Rome during March of this year, and also from youth around the world who made their views known to the Vatican online.\u201d And what of the infamous Instrumentum Laboris, drafted by the crafty Cardinal Baldisseri, Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops, noteworthy of the infamous First Synod on the Family? Known for his manipulative polls and magical modernistic results, Baldisseri infamously stated that \u201cdogma has its own evolution.\u201d Baldisseri stayed true to his modernist form and agenda and to the delight of the New Ways Ministry, he announced at the Vatican press conference that his office is using for the first time ever the LGBT acronym to refer to gay people in a spirit of inclusion. Lest there be any doubt about the secret agenda and outcome of this Synod, Cardinal Baldisseri raises the exclusion rainbow flag. Baldisseri notes that the upcoming Synod is to \u201cmake the entire Church aware of its important mission to accompany every young person, none excluded.\u201d This papacy is awash in the prissy, pop psycho speak, jargon of accompaniment, listening, and dialogue dazzling the media with empty tropes and luring the uncatechized into its globalist mantra of one world new age religion. Not surprisingly, Baldisseri never once mentions that dreaded word, dogma in the Instrumentum Laboris, but effuses about accompaniment 136 times! This doltish and dimwitted document wreaks of psycho babble, insults the intelligence of young people, and will destroy the future of the Church. Welcome to the dumbing down of the Catholic Faith by the St. Gallen Mafia and their don, Jorge Bergoglio. This Synod will exploit the youth and seminarians, just like Ted McCarrick. The handwriting is all over the 37 foot Vatican wall. The time to take a stand against this radical hijacking of Holy Mother Church is now. Expose and rout every last predator. Purge every homosexual from its clerical ranks. #StopTheSynod. It has all the markings of a Gay Pride Rally. __________________________________________ Elizabeth Yore is an attorney and international child rights advocate who has investigated clergy sex abuse cases.

        "content": "Ex-Sailor Pardoned By Trump Says He\u2019s SUING Obama And Comey  A former Navy sailor, who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump, is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials. Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, says he was subject to unequal protection of the law. Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked. He has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton\u2019s emails. According to Fox News, Saucier argues that the same officials who sought out punishment to Saucier for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information. Saucier\u2019s lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others. Saucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009. He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine\u2019s propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera. \u2013Fox News \u201cThey interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,\u201d Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free. Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren\u2019t treated as criminals. We want them to correct the wrong.\u201d Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December. There is usually a six-month period that must elapse before the lawsuit actually is actually filed. \u201cMy case was usually something handled by military courts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,\u201d he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons. \u201cWith a pardon, there\u2019s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,\u201d Saucier said, \u201cBut I try to stay positive and look forward.\u201d Saucier has had cars repossessed and is in debt due to the loss of income after having a felony on his record. The government actively destroyed his life an made it all but impossible for his family to get back on track. But Hillary Clinton is running around free, to this day. And that is what Saucier is so burnt about, with good reason.  ",

        "content": "Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange  It is welcome that finally there has been a little pushback, including from leading journalists, to the Guardian\u2019s long-running vilification of Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks. Reporter Luke Harding\u2019s latest article, claiming that Donald Trump\u2019s disgraced former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly visited Assange in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London on three occasions, is so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it. Faced with the backlash, the Guardian quickly \u2013 and very quietly \u2013 rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts. Instead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, \u201csources\u201d. The propaganda function of the piece is patent. It is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump\u2019s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race. The Guardian\u2019s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party\u2019s servers. In truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved. Central actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party. Nonetheless, this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the Democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to Trump and from the damaging contents of the emails. These show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton\u2019s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost. To underscore the intended effect of the Guardian\u2019s new claims, Harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to \u201cRussians\u201d joining Manafort in supposedly meeting Assange. Manafort has denied the Guardian\u2019s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel. \u2018Responsible for Trump\u2019 The emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule. But more significantly, it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that Assange is not a publisher \u2013 and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press, as enjoyed by the Guardian or the New York Times \u2013 but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power. The intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals. That, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency. The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador\u2019s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media. It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US. And it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time. For the best part of a decade, any claims by Assange\u2019s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason Assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists, not least at the Guardian. Even when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily \u2013 and unlawfully \u2013 detained by the UK, Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report. See here and here. Now Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again. An administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange. Heavy surveillance The problem for the Guardian, which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset, is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed \u201csources\u201d. Glenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere. The environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange\u2019s fate. The idea that Manafort or \u201cRussians\u201d could have wandered into the embassy to meet Assange even once without their trail, entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous. According to Greenwald: \u201cIf Paul Manafort \u2026 visited Assange at the Embassy, there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened. The Guardian provides none of that.\u201d Former British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit. Any visits by Manafort would have been logged. In fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy\u2019s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or \u201cRussians\u201d being identified in them. It did not refer to the logs in its latest story. Murray: The problem with this latest fabrication is that [Ecuador\u2019s President] Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry. Neither Manafort nor these \u201cRussians\u201d are in the visitor logs \u2026 What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort? Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency \u2013 who were in charge of the security \u2013 would not know the identity of these alleged \u201cRussians\u201d. No fact-checking It is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true \u2013 both because Assange\u2019s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is at stake. Given this, one would have expected the Guardian\u2019s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding\u2019s story. At a very minimum, they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication. Neither precaution was taken. I worked for the Guardian for a number of years, and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication. In that lengthy process, a variety of commissioning editors, lawyers, backbench editors and the editor herself, Kath Viner, would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated. And yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through, given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of well-placed analysts and journalists from the outset. That at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had \u201cinsurance\u201d on this story. And the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services \u2013 presumably of Britain, the United States and / or Ecuador. It appears the Guardian has simply taken this story, provided by spooks, at face value. Even if it later turns out that Manafort did visit Assange, the Guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them. That is profoundly irresponsible journalism \u2013 fake news \u2013 that should be of the gravest concern to readers. A pattern, not an aberration Despite all this, even analysts critical of the Guardian\u2019s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern. Glenn Greenwald, who once had an influential column in the Guardian until an apparent, though unacknowledged, falling out with his employer over the Edward Snowden revelations, wrote a series of baffling observations about the Guardian\u2019s latest story. First, he suggested it was simply evidence of the Guardian\u2019s long-standing (and well-documented) hostility towards Assange. \u201cThe Guardian, an otherwise solid and reliable paper, has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for Julian Assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him.\u201d It was also apparently evidence of the paper\u2019s clickbait tendencies: \u201cThey [Guardian editors] knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story, and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it, and that they\u2019d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false.\u201d And finally, in a bizarre tweet, Greenwald opined, \u201cI hope the story [maligning Assange] turns out true\u201d \u2013 apparently because maintenance of the Guardian\u2019s reputation is more important than Assange\u2019s fate and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned. I think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists. I hope the story turns out true. But the skepticism over this story is very widespread, including among Assange's most devoted haters, because it's so sketchy. If Manafort went there, there's video. Let's see it. \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 28, 2018 Deeper malaise What this misses is that the Guardian\u2019s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity. They are entirely predictable and systematic. Rather than being the reason for the Guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics, the paper\u2019s hatred of Assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the Guardian and the wider corporate media. Even aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from \u201csolid and reliable\u201d, as Greenwald claims. It has been at the forefront of the relentless, and unhinged, attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israel\u2019s right to continue its belligerent occupation. Over the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby\u2019s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite. See here, here and here. Similarly, the Guardian worked tirelessly to promote Clinton and undermine Sanders in the 2016 Democratic nomination process \u2013 another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that Assange, aided by Russia, was determined to promote Trump over Clinton for the presidency. The Guardian\u2019s coverage of Latin America, especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive US hegemony in the region, has long grated with analysts and experts. Its especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Chavez, democratically elected but official enemies of the US, rather than the region\u2019s rightwing authoritarians beloved of Washington. The Guardian has been vocal in the so-called \u201cfake news\u201d hysteria, decrying the influence of social media, the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative. The Guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by Russian trolls, arguing that this should justify ever-tighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right. Heroes of the neoliberal order Equally, the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are. Certainly not Corbyn or Assange, who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse. Its pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory \u2013 the attack on Iraq. That \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East, sucked in Islamic jihadists like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right. None of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the world\u2019s future. The Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins, who, aided by the Guardian, has shot to unlikely prominence as a self-styled \u201cweapons expert\u201d. Like Luke Harding, Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying \u201cindependently\u201d. Higgins and his well-staffed website Bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues, taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote US and NATO hegemony while demonising Russia, especially in highly contested arenas such as Syria. That clear partisanship should be no surprise, given that Higgins now enjoys an \u201cacademic\u201d position at, and funding from, the Atlantic Council, a high-level, Washington-based think-tank founded to drum up support for NATO and justify its imperialist agenda. Improbably, the Guardian has adopted Higgins as the poster-boy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as \u201cfake news\u201d whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of state-backed organisations. The truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him. With this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake \u2013 it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative. Its job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: whether they are a platform like Wikileaks promoting whistle-blowing against a corrupt western elite; or a politician like Jeremy Corbyn seeking to break apart the status quo on the rapacious financial industries or Israel-Palestine; or a radical leader like Hugo Chavez who threatened to overturn a damaging and exploitative US dominance of \u201cAmerica\u2019s backyard\u201d; or social media dissidents who have started to chip away at the elite-friendly narratives of corporate media, including the Guardian. The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence. It did what it is designed to do. UPDATE: Excellent background from investigative journalist Gareth Porter, published shortly before Harding\u2019s story, explains why the Guardian\u2019s hit-piece is so important for those who want Assange out of the embassy and behind bars.

Despite barbed wires and thousands of troops on the border, they have been undeterred.

The migrants previously made a days-long stop in Mexico City.

A Statement from the White House read as follows: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Grants of Clemency (Full Pardons) for Dwight Lincoln Hammond, Jr., and his son, Steven Hammond. The Hammonds are multi-generation cattle ranchers in Oregon imprisoned in connection with a fire that leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land. The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds\u2019 responsibility for the fire was conflicting, and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. At the Hammonds\u2019 original sentencing, the judge noted that they are respected in the community and that imposing the mandatory minimum, 5-year prison sentence would \u201cshock the conscience\u201d and be \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the severity\u201d of their conduct. As a result, the judge imposed significantly lesser sentences. The previous administration, however, filed an overzealous appeal that resulted in the Hammonds being sentenced to five years in prison. This was unjust. Dwight Hammond is now 76 years old and has served approximately three years in prison. Steven Hammond is 49 and has served approximately four years in prison. They have also paid $400,000 to the United States to settle a related civil suit. The Hammonds are devoted family men, respected contributors to their local community, and have widespread support from their neighbors, local law enforcement, and farmers and ranchers across the West. Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency. Well, it took long enough, but thank you President Trump. You did the right thing in this matter. And for all those who took the time to keep this story alive and urge people to petition the White House on behalf of the Hammonds, thank you! It should be noted that the protests that took place in Oregon a couple of years ago were a response to the injustice the Hammonds faced. As a result, Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum was killed by Oregon State Police. Those who led the protest were all acquitted of all charges and reporter Pete Santilli had all of his charges dismissed. No doubt, Finicum would have been found not guilty as well, but that's not how tyrants work, is it? Today is a day to celebrate a wrong that has not been fully made right, but has definitely turned in the right direction! Article posted with permission from The Washington Standard  ",

When the court case completely collapsed, the media buried the story. Just as it failed to provide any meaningful information about the background of the case. That was in part because it would have been damaging to Obama. And because they didn't care. But President Trump listened to the voices asking him for justice. Today, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Grants of Clemency (Full Pardons) for Dwight Lincoln Hammond, Jr., and his son, Steven Hammond.

This was unjust. Dwight Hammond is now 76 years old and has served approximately three years in prison The same administration that was against mandatory minimums for its drug dealers and gang members went to court to defend mandatory minimums under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. While Obama pardoned drug dealers and locked up ranchers, Trump pardons ranchers and locks up drug dealers. Both men are currently in prison on five-year sentences, thanks in part to a 1996 antiterrorism law that imposed a mandatory minimum sentence on certain crimes on federal land. The length of their prison terms, in part, fueled outrage at their convictions. Federal Judge Michael Robert Hogan originally gave the Hammonds reduced sentences in 2012, arguing that the mandatory minimums were unjust. But the Obama administration appealed, and federal Judge Ann Aiken in 2015 imposed the full five-year sentences. Hogan was a Bush appointee who respected the law. Aiken was a Dem fundraiser, her husband was the chair of the Oregon Dem party, appointed by Bill Clinton. Aiken was unqualified for her role, except in the ways that mattered to the Clintons and their Dem allies. These pardons cleanse another stain from our nation's history in the dark years of Obama.

The Pope couldn\u2019t resist an anti-Semitic shot at Israeli \u201coccupation,\u201d but he also seemed to denounce Islamic jihad activity, saying: \u201cSo many conflicts have been stoked too by forms of fundamentalism and fanaticism that, under the guise of religion, have profaned God\u2019s name \u2013 which is peace \u2013 and persecuted age-old neighbors.\u201d He decried the \u201cthirst for profit that surreptitiously exploits oil and gas fields without regard for our common home, with no scruples about the fact that the energy market now dictates the law of coexistence among peoples!\u201d The Pope lamented the fact that in recent years the Middle East has been \u201ccovered by dark clouds of war, violence and destruction, instances of occupation and varieties of fundamentalism, forced migration and neglect.\u201d And he deplored the fact that \u201call this has taken place amid the complicit silence of many. The Middle East has become a land of people who leave their own lands behind.\u201d He cried: \u201cIndifference kills, and we desire to lift up our voices in opposition to this murderous indifference. For the Middle East today is weeping, suffering and silent as others trample upon those lands in search of power or riches.\u201d These are odd statements coming from Pope Francis, a world-class Islamopanderer; notice that he said nothing about who was doing the persecuting, and implied that it was the fault of powers outside the Middle East. The Catholic Church as a whole has committed itself to Islamopandering, such that it is largely silent about the Muslim persecution of Christians that has taken place in the Middle East. Why? The Catholic Church is following Pope Francis\u2019 lead, and Francis has said: \u201cChristian terrorism does not exist, Jewish terrorism does not exist, and Muslim terrorism does not exist. They do not exist.\u201d And he has also said: \u201cAuthentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.\u201d take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

This has had a terrible influence upon the Catholic Church, and aids and abets the Western political and media elites in their determination to cover up the Muslim persecution of Christians. Jean-Cl\u00e9ment Jeanbart, the Melkite Greek Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, gave an interview to a French reporter in which he was highly critical of the mainstream media and even of his fellow bishops for ignoring the Muslim persecution of Middle Eastern Christians. \u201cThe European media,\u201d he charged, \u201chave not ceased to suppress the daily news of those who are suffering in Syria and they have even justified what is happening in our country by using information without taking the trouble to verify it.\u201d And as for his brother bishops in France, \u201cthe conference of French bishops should have trusted us, it would have been better informed. Why are your bishops silent on a threat that is yours today as well? Because the bishops are like you, raised in political correctness. But Jesus was never politically correct, he was politically just!\u201d Archbishop Jeanbart was not the first to say this. \u201cWhy, we ask the western world, why not raise one\u2019s voice over so much ferocity and injustice?\u201d asked Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, the head of the Italian Bishops Conference (CEI). Syriac Catholic Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem Joseph III Younan himself has in the past appealed to the West\u201cnot to forget the Christians in the Middle East.\u201d The former Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch Gregory III has also said: \u201cI do not understand why the world does not raise its voice against such acts of brutality.\u201d But Gregory III should have understood, since he was a major part of the problem. He himself said: \u201cNo one defends Islam like Arab Christians.\u201d It is to defend Islam that Western clerics do not raise their voice against such acts of brutality. It is to pursue a fruitless and chimerical \u201cdialogue\u201d that bishops in the U.S. and Europe keep silent about Muslim persecution of Christians, and enforce that silence upon others. Robert McManus, Roman Catholic Bishop of Worcester, Massachusetts, said it on February 8, 2013 as he was suppressing a planned talk at a Catholic conference on that persecution: \u201cTalk about extreme, militant Islamists and the atrocities that they have perpetrated globally might undercut the positive achievements that we Catholics have attained in our inter-religious dialogue with devout Muslims.\u201d Remember that Mohamed Atta, about the plane he had hijacked on September 11, 2001, told passengers over the intercom: \u201cStay quiet and you\u2019ll be OK.\u201d The Catholic Church appears to have adopted that statement as its policy regarding Muslim persecution of Christians. \u201cLeave them; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.\u201d (Matthew 15:14) Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer  ",
